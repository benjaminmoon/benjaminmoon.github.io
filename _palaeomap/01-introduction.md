This guide takes you through two different work flows to create palaeogeographical maps and plot occurrences fossil taxa in R. All the code and data are in this GitHub repository: <https://github.com/benjaminmoon/palaeomap_example>

You can download and run this code directly on your machine, or follow along online at Binder where I've created an environment with all of the data you need. Click the link below to open this in your web browser.

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/benjaminmoon/palaeomap_example/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio)

The Binder link will open in your browser in the RStudio interface. Open the file `palaeomap_labgroup.Rmd` from the file browser to get started.
