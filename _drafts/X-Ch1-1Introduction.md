Ichthyosaur specimens are, relatively speaking, not uncommon in the
Middle and Upper Jurassic of the UK. Indeed, in some horizons they may
form the majority of large vertebrate remains found. Despite this, these
later ichthyosaurs have often been sidelined because of the greater
attention paid to the more spectacular Lias Group fossils found so
abundantly along the Dorset and Yorkshire coasts. Continued and repeated
transgressions through the Middle Jurassic (Aalenian--Bathonian;
[@Hallam2001]) covered much of southern England with shallow but
productive seas by the late Middle and early Late Jurassic
(Callovian--Kimmeridgian), which supported a complex food web, with
ichthyosaurs dominating the upper tiers
[@Bradshaw1992; @Martill1994; @Wilkinson2008]. These seas are
represented by the two great clay formations (Oxford Clay and Kimmeridge
Clay formations) that dominate the later part of the Jurassic in
Britain, and extend to north-western Europe. The frequency with which
ichthyosaur fossils have been, and are still, uncovered, and their
occasional completeness, makes these formations important sources of
ichthyosaur remains; the relative scarcity of adequate descriptions
belies this richness and diversity of specimens. The ages of these
ichthyosaur-bearing formations, between the comparatively well-known
ichthyosaurs of the Lower Jurassic and the Lower Cretaceous, makes this
an important transitional episode between the two groups. During this
time, Ophthalmosauridae originated and diversified, leading to the
separation of the subclades Ophthalmosaurinae and Platypterygiinae
[@Fischer2013a]. The palaeogeographical position of the British Isles,
along a seaway that joined the Tethyan and Boreal marine realms, makes
this an important junction between those two disparate ichthyosaur
faunas [@Bradshaw1992].

The amount of material, particularly incomplete specimens, has caused
differences in opinions on the taxonomy of these ichthyosaurs [e.g. 
@Lydekker1888; @Huene1922b; @McGowan1976]. Middle and Upper Jurassic
ichthyosaurs suffer especially from the number of taxa based upon single
and short series of vertebral centra [@Owen1840; @Phillips1871], which
essentially do not change form between the Lower Jurassic and
Cretaceous. This monograph aims to resolve the taxonomy and affinities
of British Middle and Upper Jurassic ichthyosaurs by reappraising and
re-describing the available material within a modern, systematic
framework. It is based upon the unpublished, although ubiquitous, Ph.D.
thesis of Dr Angela @Kirton1983, who has graciously passed on her text
and illustrations. However, all the material has been re-examined by BCM
and full descriptions written anew, which form the main part of this
monograph. With the most available material, *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*
[Seeley, -@Seeley1874]
([1.1](#fig:NHM-Oicenicus-mount){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:NHM-Oicenicus-mount"}) is described first in detail
([\[Oicenicus\]](#Oicenicus){reference-type="ref"
reference="Oicenicus"}). *Brachypterygius extremus* [Boulenger,
-@Boulenger1904] ([\[Bextremus\]](#Bextremus){reference-type="ref"
reference="Bextremus"}), *Nannopterygius enthekiodon* [Hulke,
-@Hulke1871] ([\[Nenthekiodon\]](#Nenthekiodon){reference-type="ref"
reference="Nenthekiodon"}), and *Macropterygius*
sp. ([1.5.1.6](#Macropterygiusspindet){reference-type="ref"
reference="Macropterygiusspindet"}) are also described more briefly
([1.5.1](#tax:taxavalida){reference-type="ref"
reference="tax:taxavalida"}), and these four species are compared to
other ichthyosaur taxa with a focus on recently identified phylogenetic
characters ([1.6](#OsteologicalComparisons){reference-type="ref"
reference="OsteologicalComparisons"}). Invalid British Middle and Upper
Jurassic taxa are listed with discussion
([1.5.2](#Taxainvalida){reference-type="ref" reference="Taxainvalida"}).
Brief discussion is made on the variation and taxonomic relations of
*Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*
([\[synonymyOphthalmosaurusBaptanodon,OicenicusKimmClay\]](#synonymyOphthalmosaurusBaptanodon,OicenicusKimmClay){reference-type="ref"
reference="synonymyOphthalmosaurusBaptanodon,OicenicusKimmClay"}), and
the palaeobiogeography of Middle and Upper Jurassic ichthyosaurs
([\[tax:palaeobiogeography\]](#tax:palaeobiogeography){reference-type="ref"
reference="tax:palaeobiogeography"}).
