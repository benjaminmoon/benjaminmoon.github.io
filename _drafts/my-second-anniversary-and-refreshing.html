<p>Having had a monstrously busy summer, I haven’t been around to write and update this blog much. I have had many exciting adventures, conferences and field trips to enjoy, which have taken to such exotic places as Paris, Edinburgh and Weston-super-Mare.</p>
<p>Just over a week ago, I had a message from WordPress congratulating me on the second anniversary of this blog’s existence. As a reminder, it was quite nice; marking the beginning of my third (and likely final) year and Ph.D. study. It seems that now would also be a good time to put out what I’d like to do with this blog now.</p>
<p>The dearth of posts here has mostly been due to me spending so much time on some quite big pieces of work, which are making their way towards the light of day. In the meantime I want to post further little snippets of things that I find interesting and intriguing; hopefully you will do too.</p>
<p>As for now, I feel this blog needs a slight refresh, and so have decided to change up its themes a little. Although broadly similar to the old look (Twenty Eleven), this new version (Twenty Ten – yes it is an older theme!) has a couple of things I like. Mostly it has a different font set  with a slightly more classical feel to it (serifs and text figures). I find the field of typography interesting, especially the evolution of font families and combinations (nerd!).</p>
<p>But what about topics for the blog? Typography could feature…maybe. As for the ichthyosaurs, I will continue to post about intriguing papers. The pages I’ve set up will be continued and developed: ichthyosaur systematics is part of my current projects, so will be a big input to add for this. Doubtless further ichthyosaurs will be found, described and named, improving the taxonomy page. Biology will feature more too, completing the set.</p>
<p>All of these won’t be an immediate change or excess of posts: this are all things for the next year. Rest assured that I am still around, and that I will continue to work on this blog and spread the joy of ichthyosaurs to the world at large. Stay tuned to continue this fantastical exploration.</p>
