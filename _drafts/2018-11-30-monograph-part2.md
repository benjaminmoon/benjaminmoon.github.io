While [part one](/cv/2016-11-30-monograph-Ophthalmosaurus/) of this monograph
covered one taxon, _Ophthalmosaurus,_ part two includes three different
ichthyosaur taxa, and a few others that aren't considered valid. _Brachypterygius_ and _Nannopterygius_ are the two better-known ichthyosaurs,
both from the Late Jurassic of the UK, and both funky and unusual in their own
ways. Additionally there is the potential taxon _Macropterygius_ that is known
from particularly poor remains, but seems to represent a different taxon.
