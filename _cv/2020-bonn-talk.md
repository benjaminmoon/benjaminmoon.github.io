The joy of a lockdown and online working is being able to invite and speak
around the world in places you otherwise might not be able to get to. Sure you
miss out on the visiting bit, seeing collections, exploring the town, but you
still can see and talk to other people from across the world whose research
overlaps. This talk was presented at a discussion group of the University of Bonn
palaeobiology group, alongside another talk by Alexandra Houssaye, by invite
from Ren√© Dederichs for a session entailed 'Two Persons I Quoted in my Bachelor
Thesis.'

Here I spoke about measuring diversity trends in ichthyosaurs, other marine
tetrapods, and interesting points of their evolution at three different levels:

1. _Raw taxonomic diversity:_ both from currently assigned and valid species,
   as well as potentially increasing this with new discoveries of material
   worldwide, and reassessment of substantial material currently available from
   poorly studied periods. We had good discussion afterwards about the
   potential diversity in the Rhaetian and what this means for a sudden
   end-Triassic extinction or a longer Late Triassic turnover.
2. _Morphological diversity:_ using geometric, cladistic, and functional traits
   to characterise and explore changes through ichthyosaur evolution, including
   issues of completeness and how this can affect the quality of results. I also
   included some of the use of fluid dynamics for investigating whole-body
   morphology.
3. _Ecological diversity:_ including work that came out last year showing how
   ichthyosaurs were an important component of marine ecosystems throughout the
   Mesozoic, but were only one among many different niches marine tetrapods
   occupied.
