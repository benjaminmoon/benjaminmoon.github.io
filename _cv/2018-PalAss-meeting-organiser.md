I helped to organise the 2018 PalAss Annual Meeting along with Jakob Vinther,
John Cunningham, Tom Davies, Phil Donoghue, Emily Rayfield, Dani Schmidt, and
others. My main duties were the poster session, Watchet field trip, and creating
the programme foldout.

The foldout was perhaps my favourite thing to create the foldout: showing the
entire programme for the conference in two pages. You can see a [PDF
here](https://k00.fr/xtefmbzp). I also made a [field guide
(PDF)](https://k00.fr/r9a7f3vt) for the
two field trips to Watchet and Aust.
