For her MSc project Terri Cleary assessed how ichthyosaur skeletal completeness
varied through time using metrics devised by [Mannion & Upchurch
(2010)](https://doi.org/10.1666/09008.1) and [Beardmore et al.
(2012)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12549-011-0066-0).

Ichthyosaur completeness varies greatly through the Mesozoic, but there are
trends within the data. High levels of completeness are associated particularly
with Lagerstätten, as is to be expected, medium-sized specimens tended to be
more complete than the larger or smaller size groups, and specimens from the
northern hemisphere were more complete than from the southern hemisphere.

At least some of this may be due to availability of specimens: more specimens
are collected from Lagerstätten in the northern hemisphere and are medium-sized;
and so more of these specimens were included in the data. There are other
potential biases related to the preservation and collection potential of these
specimens that should be taken into account in studied of the diversity of
ichthyosaurs and other fossil groups.
