Rates of evolution in ichthyosaurs have been considered a few times previously
(Fischer et al. 2016, Motani et al. 2017), but not at the level of the whole group and
for the 160 million years of their existence. We aimed to combine discrete and
continuous characters for all valid ichthyosaur species to examine their
evolutionary rates throughout the Mesozoic.

We used cladistic data from a previous phylogeny of ichthyosaurs that
I published in 2019
(doi:[10.1080/14772019.2017.1394922](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14772019.2017.1394922))
and collected additional skull length for 64 ichthyosaur species. Then we put
these data through an extensive set of analyses to calculate rates of change
from a range of trees produced by Moon (2019).

Ichthyosaurs had an archetypal ‘early burst’ of evolution following their first
appearance: high rates of evolution early on in their history. This manifests
itself as a rapid diversification in taxonomy, morphology, and ecology during
the Early–Middle Triassic followed by relatively slower rates.

    changes in skull length occur early in ichthyosaur evolution before
    decreasing in the later Triassic and again in the Late Jurassic. (From Moon and Stubbs 2020.)"

The deceleration of evolution seems to be particularly impactful following the
bottleneck that ichthyosaurs went through in the latest Triassic. Jurassic and
Cretaceous ichthyosaurs were significantly less disparate and evolved less
quickly than Triassic species.

We caveat these results because we used only valid taxon referrals, and so did
not incorporate the portly preserved remains of the Rhaetian that have recently
been reported (Fischer et al. 2014; Lomax et al. 2018), or the ecological variety of the
Cretaceous (Fischer et al. 2016). However, we suggest our results are robust as we did
not focus solely on ecology, and also included a selection of tree topologies
and dating methods, attempting to remove the effects of fossil record
uncertainty and find a representative range of evolutionary rates.
