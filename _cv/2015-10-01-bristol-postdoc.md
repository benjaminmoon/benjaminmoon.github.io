My first postdoctoral position was part of a Leverhulme Trust funded
project to research the palaeontology of the Strawberry Bank lagerst√§tte,
a Toarcian (Early Jurassic) locality in Somerset, UK.

My primary role was to CT scan the vertebrate material using the newly acquired CT scanner at the University of Bristol.
