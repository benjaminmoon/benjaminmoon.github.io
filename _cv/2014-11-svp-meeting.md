My first visit to a Society of Vertebrate Paleontology Annual Meeting was in
2014 when it came to Berlin. Not only was this a great chance to visit the
Museum für Naturkunde, but also my largest conference to date and a great chance
to meet many new people, explore the city, and experience the legendary SVP
closing party.

In this talk I presented my ongoing struggles to resolve ichthyosaur phylogeny,
and first results of a cladistic morphospace for ichthyosaur evolution at the
species level. These later evolved into two papers (Moon 2019; Moon & Stubbs
2020).

It was even more memorable as the meeting occurred around the 25th anniversary of the
fall of the Berlin Wall, so the group of us visited some of the ceremonies and
the line of lights placed along the route of the wall.

### Abstract

Two centuries of ichthyosaur research have revealed a great deal of information
on the anatomy of ichthyosaurs. Recent research has put this in a systematic
context using numerical phylogenetic methods, but many of these have only
considered the group down to genus level, and many include a limited taxon
sample. Here, I present new phylogenies for the Ichthyopterygia, coded to
species level, and including every reasonably complete taxon. The data matrix
comprises over 280 characters, built using a critical supermatrix methodology,
coded for almost 100 taxa. Characters from these analyses were evaluated based
on similarity, informativeness and exclusivity; reductive coding and
non-additive binary coding methods were preferred. Character codings were
derived mostly from published descriptions, focusing on type specimens where
possible. Analysis was completed using several parsimony- and likelihood-based
methods. These include the heuristic search, ratchet and drift functions in
PAUP* and TNT, and Mk model Bayesian analysis in Mr Bayes. The phylogenies
produced similar topologies from all methods, and in comparison to to previous
studies, but several genera were found to be paraphyletic, such as _Ichthyosaurus_
and _Stenopterygius_. Other subclades within the Ichthyopterygia were found to be
well supported, and these mark transitions in several character states, for
example Mixosauridae and Ophthalmosauridae. Bayesian analysis yielded poor
resolution, except for clades supported by several characters. This suggests
that the characters used are not all truly informative in a likelihood context:
the higher resolution found in parsimony analyses may therefore be misleading.
These new results show the need to reappraise the taxonomy of several
ichthyosaurian taxa, particularly within the Mixosauridae and several Liassic
taxa, for example _Ichthyosaurus_ and _Temnodontosaurus_. Despite this, these data
allow preliminary analysis of large-scale trends within the evolution of the
Ichthyopterygia. The group generally shows gradual acquisition of characters
throughout its evolution, punctuated by times of rapid diversification, as
marked by the best-supported clades. The combination of the new, comprehensive
phylogeny and comparative analysis sheds new light on the key macroevolutionary
models and phases in ichthyosaurian evolution.
