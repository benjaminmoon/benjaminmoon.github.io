While [part one](/cv/2016-11-30-monograph-Ophthalmosaurus/) of this monograph
covered one taxon, _Ophthalmosaurus,_ part two includes three different
ichthyosaur taxa, and a few others that aren't considered valid.
_Brachypterygius_ and _Nannopterygius_ are the two better-known ichthyosaurs,
both from the Late Jurassic of the UK, and both funky and unusual in their own
ways. Additionally there is the potential taxon _Macropterygius_ that is known
from particularly poor remains, but seems to represent a different taxon.

    caption="_Brachypterygius_ in Bristol Museum and Art Gallery."

Surprisingly there are relatively few complete and articulated ichthyosaur
specimens from the Late Jurassic. Of those only _Nannopterygius_ was known
historically from a single specimen, of which
[_Ophthalmosaurus_](/cv/2016-11-30-monograph-Ophthalmosaurus/) has been put
together from multiple specimens (Andrews 1915). More recent collections by
Steve Etches has led to a whole new museum full of excellently-preserved
ichthyosaurs.

    caption="Perhaps my best view of _Nannopterygius_ in the Natural History
    Museum , London. Tall as I am I just couldn't reach it."

And at the end I also compared the material to an American taxon,
_Baptanodon/Ophthalmosaurus_ with some re-drawings that I'm quite proud of, even
if they are relatively simple.

    caption="Redrawn outlines of the skull of _Baptanodon/Ophthalmosaurus_
    natans (after Gilmore 1905; from Moon & Krton 2018)." %}

While I, in this monograph, described the available British material, both
_Brachypterygius_ and _Nannopterygius_ have undergone further revision based on
worldwide finds, particularly from Russia (Zverkov et al. 2015; Zverkov and
Jacobs 2020). A few of my interpretations have been changed, such as the limb
moprhology in _Nannopterygius,_ and I may not fully agree with including the
Bristol Museum specimen in _Grendelius_ rather than _Brachypterygius,_ however,
much of my observations have been corroborated. In certain cases more extensive
and complete material is required to make extensive comparisons.
