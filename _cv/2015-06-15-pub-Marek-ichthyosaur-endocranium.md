In a first for ichthyosaurs we presented a 3D reconstruction and endocranium of
the Early Jurassic ichthyosaur _Hauffiopteryx typicus_, as part of Ryan Marek's
MSci project.

Ryan was able to segment the bones from a CT scan of this specimen from teh
BRLSI Charles Moore collection, but even more exciting he reconstructed the
endocast of this ichthyosaur. This is the space within the skull that housed the
brain, and its shape can tell us about the relationship and sensory capabilities
of animals.

Previous to this, only _Ichthyosaurus_ had been reconstructed by McGowan (1973)
using latex casting. We found similarities in the shape of the endocast, but
there are some differences that could be related to preservation or growth
stage. Nonetheless, we found support for excellent eyesight in ichthyosaurs, as well as
some evidence for strong smell.
