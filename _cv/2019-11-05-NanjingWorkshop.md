In late 2019 I was asked to help lead a workshop at Nanjing University entitled _Phylogenetics in Palaeobiology_ alongside Mike Benton and invited and hosted by Baoyu Jiang and Qingyi Tian. This workshop introduced the development and theory behind cladistics and gave experience in modern phylogenetic analysis.
