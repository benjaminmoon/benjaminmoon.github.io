A long time coming, but hopefully should be a useful addition. Darren Naish and I
contributed a chapter to the Kimmeridge Clay volume of the Palaeontological
Association _Field Guides to Fossils_ series, edited by Dave Martill and Steve
Etches.

Here we present a brief overview of identified material from the Kimmeridge Clay
Formation – as of when we completed the chapter – which amounted to
_Brachypterygius_ and _Nannopterygius_ with names at the time, and other
material known mainly as _Ichthyosaurus trigonus._ So many specimens on single
vertebrae are present, but there are a few complete historical specimens, and
many more found recently by and in the Steve Etches collection.
