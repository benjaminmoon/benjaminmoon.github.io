This project was completed by Antonio while he was an MSc student at the
University of Bristol. We used CT scan data of two crocodiles: _Pelagosaurus_,
from 180 million years ago, and a modern gharial (_Gavialis_) to recreate and
compare their musculature and jaw mechanics – the way that they bite.

While these two crocodiles look superficially similar, both having long snouts,
they are different in the amount of muscle that the skulls can hold and thus the
resulting forces created when biting. The gharial has a larger muscle chamber
and somewhat more robust skull that can handle the forces more easily. However,
despite differences, it is still likely that both these crocodiles had a similar
diet and feeding method: catching fast-moving, slippery prey, possibly by
ambush.

We also looked at how these feeding-related features of the skull changed across
the whole tree of crocodiles. In particular, there are rapid rates of change in
the clade Thalattosuchia. These are marine crocodiles that first evolved in the
Early Jurassic and have characteristically elongated snouts, including
_Pelagosaurus_. The shift in skull morphology gave these crocodiles 'low
mechanical advantage', resulting a less powerful but faster bite. This appears
to be linked to moving into water and changing to eating more fish, and
fast-moving prey.
