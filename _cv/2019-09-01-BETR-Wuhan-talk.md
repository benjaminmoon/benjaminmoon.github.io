This workshop at China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China was to introduce students to the research and innovations of the Biosphere Evolution, Transitions and Resilience (BETR) project; a NERC funded project between several institutions in China and the UK. It included several days of talks in Wuhan followed by a fieldtrip to the Three Gorges Dam region to view the Ediacaran, Ordovician, and Permian–Triassic sequences. [The website for the workshop is here.](http://www.betr-palaeo.org/wuhan-betr-workshop.html)
