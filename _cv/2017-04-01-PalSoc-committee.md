I've been a member of the Palaeontographical Society Committee since 2017,
contributing to the running of the society.

The [Palaeontographical Society](https://www.palaeosoc.org/site/home/) is the
oldest palaeontological society in the world. Its purpose is to publish
descriptions of British fossils through its [monograph
series](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/tmps20/current).
