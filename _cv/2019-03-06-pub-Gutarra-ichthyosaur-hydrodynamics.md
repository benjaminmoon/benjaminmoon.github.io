As part of her PhD, Susana Gutarra has been modelling ichthyosaur hydrodynamics,
investigating the effects of body morphology on their swimming ability. This was
earlier a project that I started then gave to MSc student Alison Brimacombe, and
Susana added lots of fluid dynamical knowledge and finesse.

Here we used 3D models, based on exceptionally preserved ichthyosaur specimens
from throughout their phylogeny, in computational fluid dynamics simulations to
explore how the changing shape of ichthyosaurs affect the amount of drag and
lift generated.

We expected to see a clear trend where the later ichthyosaurs, traditionally
considered to be better adapted to life in the oceans, had reduced the amount of
drag generated, and so could put more of their effort into swimming forward.

    caption="Despite very different morphologies, there was only a very minor
    effect on the drag generated in computaional fluid dynamics models, and a
    lot of spread. The depth of the body seems to be the most important factor,
    rather the the shape as a whole. From Gutarra et al. (2019)."

However, the story is more complex. While morphology does have some minor effect
on drag, what becomes more important is the ability to create thrust to overcome
this. We therefore looked at the total cost of transport â€“ how much effort do
you have to put into going forwards. This did seem to reduce through ichthyosaur
phylogeny, while also being heavily affected by the size of things.

    caption="Cost of transport for a series of ichthyosaurs shows that a more
    dolphin- or tuna-like shape, and getting bigger, can help reduce the amount
    of effort needed for swimming. From Gutarra et al. (2019)."

Our summary was that getting bigger and swimming in a more efficient manner,
like dolphins or tuna, are your best bets for reducing effort.
