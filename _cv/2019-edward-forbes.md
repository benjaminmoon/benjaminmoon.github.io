I was awarded the 2019 Edward Forbes Prize by the Palaeontographical Society for my monograph _Ichthyosaurs of the British Middle and Upper Jurassic. Part 2._ Brachypterygius, Nannopterygius, Macropterygius _and_ Taxa invalida. The [Edward Forbes Prize](https://www.palaeosoc.org/site/page/grants-and-prizes/research-funding-details) recognises 'outstanding contributions by early career researchers in the field of taxonomic and systematic palaeontology'.
