This was my second presentation at a Society of Vertebrate Paleontology
conference, after Berlin in 2014, although this one will probably stick in my
memory more as I had a large trip across Canada – Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto –
around the conference itself.

My talk here presented ongoing work related to the Strawberry Bank lagerstätte
in the UK and some of the three-dimensional material that I CT scanned and have
segmented – alongside interns and students who had helped me along this way.
I also showed some preliminary reconstructions of the muscle attachments points
for the jaw adductor chambers.

### Abstract

The Early Jurassic had the highest raw diversity of ichthyosaur taxa in the
Mesozoic, yet not the highest disparity or ecological variation. Two great
lagerstätten – the Lias Group and Posidonia Shale – have preserved abundant
specimens representing this diversity, but three-dimensional specimens are rare.
Morphological differences in the ichthyosaur taxa present at this time have been
noted, but testing of ecological adaptation and niche occupation has heretofore
been infrequent. We use micro-CT scans of two highly complete,
three-dimensionally preserved ichthyosaur skulls from the Upper Lias (Toarcian)
Strawberry Bank lagerstätte of Somerset, U.K. – referred to _Hauffiopteryx
typicus_ and _Stenopterygius triscissus_ respectively – to reconstruct the internal
cranial hard and soft anatomy. _Hauffiopteryx typicus_ possesses a narrow,
elongate snout and jaw, and anteroposteriorly short postorbital region and
supratemporal fenestra – comparable to coeval Leptonectidae. The adductor cavity
is large, providing broad areas for muscle attachment. In _Stenopterygius
triscissus_ the snout is broader and more robust, and the postorbital region is
longer and supratemporal fenestra larger than in _H. typicus_ – as in other
Thunnosauria. A feature of Neoichthyosauria is the posterior position of the
paracoronoid process on the surangular, close to the jaw articulation. We find
this – coupled with extensive muscle attachment in this region – gives a high
moment arm on the lower jaw, allowing the jaw to be closed rapidly even in the
viscous medium of water. The teeth of _S. triscissus_ are longer and greater in
diameter than in _H. typicus,_ and retained in both taxa through ontogeny. We
suggest that these morphologies evidence niche partitioning between the taxa. No
direct evidence of diet was found in the specimens, but the lagerstätte
preserves numerous fishes and insects of small to large size. The deposit has
been interpreted as a 'nursery' for ichthyosaurs. The similarity of the snout
and tooth morphological in _H. typicus and_ the crocodyliform _Pelagosaurus typus_
may indicate similar feeding strategies.
