Ichthyosaurs have been a relatively common fixture of UK palaeontology since
Mary and Joseph Anning's discoveries around early 1810s, but the best specimens
and most well-known finds are in the Early Jurassic strata of Dorset, Somerset,
and up to Yorkshire. Perhaps less well-known – but no less important – are the
Middle and Late Jurassic deposits again spread across the country, but
particularly found around Peterborough and the south coast.

A good deal of my PhD work was looking at so many ichthyosaur specimens from
across the country and revisiting the taxa known from this time and place in a
bid to revise and extend the previous work of Dr Angela Kirton. The most common
and important of these is _Ophthalmosaurus,_ which makes up most of the
specimens found.

This Late Jurassic _Ophthalmosaurus_ material is particularly important for
ichthyosaur research because its some of the best examples of three-dimensional
and disarticulated, but complete material, so allows unusual access to the full
anatomy. It doesn't happen often with the more spectacular-looking material from
Lyme Regis or Holzmaden in Germany where the preserved ichthyosaurs are
complete and articulated, but flattened to the point that internal structures
are difficult to see.

With so much material of _Ophthalmosaurus_ available it's possible to
reconstruct the skull and body of this animal with relative certainty.

There are a few other taxa from the Late Jurassic of the UK that I further
described in [part two](/cv/2018-11-30-monograph-part2/).
