This is a fairly direct follow up to my [2014 SVP talk in
Berlin]({% link _cv/2014-11-svp-meeting.md %}) using an updated version of my
large ichthyosaur phylogeny (Moon 2019) and doing a more complete set of
analyses looking at cladistic disparity and the evolution of some phenotypic
traits. The titles summarises my results: ichthyosaurs didn't do such
interesting things after the Triassic (Moon & Stubbs 2020).

### Abstract

Ichthyosaurs are some of the most commonly found Mesozoic marine reptiles, and
perhaps the most completely adapted to a marine existence. Despite 200 years of
study, the relationships of ichthyosaurs are unstable and not certainly known.
By constructing a new large phylogenetic supermatrix for ichthyosaurs and
analysing and testing this using various optimisation criteria, regions of
instability have been identified that correlate with periods of rapid radiation,
such as the Early—Middle Triassic and Early Jurassic. Previous relations are
confirmed, but the monophyly of some taxa is questioned. However, this
supermatrix and the posterior sample of phylogenetic trees provides hypotheses
of ichthyosaur evolution that can be used to examine their long-term
evolutionary trends. We use cladistic morphometrics to show that there is a
shift in morphospace occupation during the Late Triassic. While morphologically
disparate in the Triassic, ichthyosaur disparity declined into the Early
Jurassic and became more conserved, but until their extinction in the early Late
Cretaceous. This differs from other diversity measures in ichthyosaurs and
marine reptiles — e.g. ecospace and functionspace occupation. Associated with
this is a deceleration of evolutionary rates in phenotypic characters: body size
and skull size, although orbital ratio shows less obvious changes. Ichthyosaur
remains are well known from several lagerstätten, but the paucity of diagnostic
fossils from key periods of turnover makes for poor resolution of timescales at
these events. Incorporation of phylogeny attempts to ameliorate these concerns,
but leaves the likelihood of a hidden diversity at key intervals.
