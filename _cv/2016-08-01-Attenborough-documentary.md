I was invited to advise and contribute to this documentary
during the proposal stage, and following commission,
further advised on the anatomy, scanning, and functional
work included in the documentary.

The programme was broadcast on [7 January 2018](/posts/ichthyosaurs/attenborough-and-the-sea-dragon/) and
followed the discovery of an ichthyosaur at Lyme Regis and
David learning more about it and the environment in which
it lived.

I helped with the CT scanning of the main specimen and
another large _Temnodontosaurus_, the segmenting and
reconstruction of the CT scans, and jaw biomechanics of
_Temnodontosaurus_, as well as advising the CGI and
production team on the science for the programme.
A write-up of the biomechanics can be found
[here](https://bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3gBPbbRKVJQxRMwYkkPqPGM/big-jaws-big-bite).
