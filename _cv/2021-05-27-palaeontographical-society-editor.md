Since May 2021 I am a co-editor of the [*Monographs of the Palaeontographical Society*](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/tmps20/current). I have previously had a monograph published in this series, one of the oldest scientific publishing series in the world.

I do a combination of copy editing for the journal style, contacting reviewers, and managing between editors typesetters and the publishers.

I enjoy the editing part greatly and am looking forward to my first edited issue coming out later this year.
