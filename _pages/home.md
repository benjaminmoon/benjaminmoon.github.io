Palaeobiologist by day, tuba player by night, and a fan of beautiful typography
during most of my waking hours.

My name is Ben and welcome to my personal website. Have a look around.

I write about things that interest me and show off what I do for work and play.
I've decided to call my website ‘Jumping Through Hoops’ because that sums up
well a lot of what I do and how I work: there's always a challenge to complete.
It also reminds me of dolphins, although not in place that I'd prefer to see
them, and I like dolphins, the sea, and the wondrous variety of critters that
live there.

_On the right, you can see me lounging at the top of the church tower in
Nordlingen, Germany, from a trip that I made there in 2017. The photo was
taken by my partner._
