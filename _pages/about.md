I am a palaeontologist currently working at the University of Bristol.
I've been especially excited about marine reptiles for many years and
have been lucky enough to work on them for my PhD and first postdoctoral
position. Mostly I research ichthyosaurs – fish-like marine reptiles
alive at the same time as dinosaurs – but more recently have been looking
at the evolution of other marine reptiles.
