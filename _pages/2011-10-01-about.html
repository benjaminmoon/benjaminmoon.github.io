<p>I am a PhD student at the University of Bristol, UK, studying Middle and Late Jurassic ichthyosaurs.  I have been a dinosaurs-and-prehistoric-animals nut since at least the age of three and have no wish to stop now!  My aim with this blog is to spread the word on ichthyosaurs and how much pleasure I get from them.  This will thus revolve around the work that I am doing, my thoughts and progress.</p>
<p>Besides palaeontology, I have a huge love for classical music and listen to, play and compose to my heart's content (which is, cumulatively, quite a lot).  My favourite composers are Jean Sibelius, Gustav Mahler and John Adams, and from this some may  be able to tell that I am very much a lover of twentieth century music (though haven't really got the hang of post-1980 pop).  I play tuba, piano and have been known to try violin and (infrequently) guitar.</p>
