<p>Here are some good links to further information on ichthyosaurs and palaeontology in general.</p>
<p><strong>Blogs and websites</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Tetrapod Zoology" href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/">Tetrapod Zoology</a> is blog on all things tetrapod-y, and much more beside. Written by Dr Darren Naish (University of Southampton, UK), the blog exhibits his enormous love and knowledge of all things four-legged.  It includes 'did you know...?' pieces as well as reviews and notices of recently published papers.</li>
<li>Ryosuke Motani has authored many important ichthyosaur papers, including the first large-scale phylogeny in 1999.  His <a title="Motani's Ichthyosaur Page" href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/people/motani/ichthyo/index.html" target="_blank">Ichthyosaur Page</a> contains much information on the group.  It has not been updated since 2000 but remains an excellent resource.  For more information see his <a title="Motani Homepage" href="http://ryosuke.motani.name/" target="_blank">home page</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Societies</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately there are no ichthyosaur specific societies (yet!), but more general vertebrate and palaeontology societies do provide a good amount of information.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a title="SVP" href="http://www.vertpaleo.org//AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home" target="_blank">Society of Vertebrate Paleontology</a> is the home of vertebrate palaeontology. It was founded in 1940 and has grown a lot since.  From 1981 it has published the <em>Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology</em>, which includes papers on all vertebrate groups, from fish to dinosaurs and more.  This is the most common publishing medium to find ichthyosaurs in.</li>
<li>The <a title="PalAss" href="http://www.palass.org/" target="_blank">Palaeontological Association</a> is Britain's main society for palaeontology.  Founded in 1957, it publishes the Journal <em>Palaeontology</em> on any and all aspects of the science.</li>
<li>The <a title="GeolSoc Lond" href="http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/index.html" target="_blank">Geological Society of London</a> the oldest geological society in the world.  As the main UK centre for geology for over 200 years it has been the first to report many important finds.  The <em>Journal of the Geological Society</em> includes the first published descriptions of ichthyosaurs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Journals</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Several journals are a good source of ichthyosaur papers. Worth mentioning are the <em><a title="JVP" href="http://www.vertpaleo.org/JVP/1855.htm" target="_blank">Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology</a></em>, the open access <em><a title="PLoS ONE" href="http://www.plosone.org/home.action" target="_blank">PLoS ONE</a></em> and important papers which appear in <em><a title="Science" href="http://www.sciencemag.org/" target="_blank">Science</a></em> and <em><a title="Nature" href="http://www.nature.com/" target="_blank">Nature</a></em>.</p>
<p><em>PLoS ONE</em> can be access for free by anyone.  <em>Science</em>, <em>Nature</em> and the <em>Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology</em> can be freely accessed by members and subscribed institutions.</p>
