Well, having given a presentation on the plans for my PhD, I feel as though
I can now share it with the world.  That and I’ve had agreement on what I plan
to do and how I plan to do.  Thus, here is an edited pseudo-transcript (mostly
made up) on my PhD plans for the next year or so.  This will be in the form of
three posts:

* Part 1: a new ichthyosaur
* [Part 2: the ichthyosaurs
  strike back](/PhD/my-phd-part-2-the-ichthyosaurs-strike-back/)
* [Part 3: the return of
  the ichthyosaurs](/PhD/my-phd-part-3-the-return-of-the-ichthyosaurs/)

My thesis is based upon an unpublished thesis of Angela Kirton (1983).  As it
stands, it is currently divided into two main projects.  These will certainly
lead on to several further projects.  The initial part is to redescribe the
three genera (group of species) of Late Jurassic ichthyosaurs from Great
Britain.  Concurrent with this, I will be comparing the three main phylogenetic
analyses from 1999a (Motani) and 2000 (Maisch and Matzke; Sander).

## Summary

As these posts will be quite long, I will put a small summary at the beginning
of each.  This way you can get the gist and come back to the details later.

The first part of my PhD will be to describe the three genera of Late Jurassic
ichthyosaurs from Britain:

* _Ophthalmosaurus_
* _Brachypterygius_
* _Nannopterygius_

These can be identified based upon features of the skull and forelimb:

* _Ophthalmosaurus_ has a very large eye
* _Brachypterygius_ has three equal-sized facets on the humerus
* _Nannopterygius_ has very tiny paddles

## Ichthyosaur basics

[Specimen abbreviations: BMNH—Natural History Museum, London (originally
British Museum (Natural History))]

There are a few small things that I must clear up and add from my ‘Introduction
to ichthyosaurs’ blog.  Firstly, how we describe different parts of
vertebrates, and where the features of interest are (fig. 1).

The front of the animal (where the head is) is called anterior.  The rear, or
tail end, is posterior: your hands are anterior to your legs.  The belly-side
is ventral whereas the back is dorsal: your spine is dorsal to your belly
button.  Each side is called the right or left lateral side: your right hand is
on the right lateral side.  Closer to the body is proximal whereas distal is
farther: your hand is distal to your elbow.

The ichthyosaurs that I am looking at show different features of the skull and
paddle.  In the skull, the size of the eye is the most obvious difference.  The
forepaddle (arm) varies in relative size, as do the number and size of the
distal facets (concave faces) on the humerus (fig. 2).

Note the three facets on the distal end of the humerus and the large number of digits (arab numerals) and phalanges (roman numerals). The anterior- and posteriormost digits are accessory digits (modified from Kirton 1983)." %}

Ichthyosaurs can have many digits (fingers) and phalanges (finger bones). 
Humans have five digits on each hand, each with three phalanges (the thumb has
two).  Some ichthyosaurs could have eight digits, each with over 20 phalanges. 
Oddly enough, these are not all the same as our five fingers. 
_Ophthalmosaurus_ (fig. 2) has six digits and up to nine phalanges on
each.  The middle four digits (fig. 2, numbered) are analogous to ours. 
However, the other two are ‘accessory digits’ from different origins.  These
definitions will be important in describing the ichthyosaurs below.

## British Upper Jurassic ichthyosaurs

The three ichthyosaur genera from the British Late Jurassic are:
_Ophthalmosaurus_, _Brachypterygius_ and
_Nannopterygius_. I will give the most visible differences of
these.

**_Ophthalmosaurus_** (oph-THAL-mo-SORE-us) is found in the
Oxford Clay of the Callovian and Oxfordian stages (~162–~155 Ma).  Some
possible remains are from the Kimmeridgian Stage (~155.6–150.8 Ma).  As the
name suggests, this ichthyosaur is famous for having a large eye (‘ophthalmo-’
is from the Latin for eye; fig. 3).  It is the largest eye compared to body
size known (Motani 1999b)!  The humerus has three distal facets. 
These articulate with the pre-axial accessory digit, the radius and the ulna
(Seeley 1874; Kirton 1983; McGowan and Motani 2003).  The anterior facet is the
smallest.  The posteriormost is oblique to the other two.

The ring of bones (sclerotic ring) would have kept the shape of the eye and assisted in focussing underwater. Modified from McGowan and Motani (2003)." %}

_Ophthalmosaurus icenicus_, the single British species, is the most
common Late Jurassic ichthyosaur.  Many specimens have been found near
Peterborough, collected by the Leeds brothers in the last half of the
19^th^ Century.  The Leeds’ Collection was largely donated to the
Natural History Museum in London, but parts went to museums around the UK.

**_Brachyterygius_** (BRACK-ip-ter-I-gi-us) is
known from the Kimmeridgian (~155.6–150.8 Ma) of Dorset but there are also some
possible finds from the Purbeck Beds (Lower Cretaceous, ~143 Ma) (Ensom et
al. 2009) and even later (Lydekker 1888; McGowan and Motani 2003).  This
genus was originally described from a forepaddle (fig. 4). 
_Brachypterygius_’s paddle also has three distal facets on the humerus,
each is subequally sized and oblique to each other (McGowan 1997).  These
facets articulate (anterior to posterior) with the radius, (unusually)
intermedium and ulna.  As with _Ophthalmosaurus_ there are four digits
with one pre- and one post-axial accessory digit.

Specimen BMNH R3177 (length about 400 mm; modified from Kirton [1983])." %}

A skull in the Sedgwick Museum, Cambridge, described as _Grendelius_,
was suggested to be _Brachypterygius_.  This was confirmed by a specimen
in Bristol Museum.  This whole body specimen posses the skull of
_Grendelius_ with the forepaddle of _Brachypterygius_ (McGowan
1997).  Because of this, _Grendelius_ was renamed
_Brachypterygius_ (the earlier name gets precedence).  There are two
species of _Brachypterygius_ from the British Late Jurassic: _B.
extremus_ (the original) and _B. mordax_ (originally _Grendelius_;
McGowan 1997).

**_Nannopterygius_** (NAN-op-ter-I-gi-us) is the most uncommon, and
unusual, of British Late Jurassic ichthyosaurs.  Only one whole body specimen,
and one forepaddle, is known.  As the ‘nanno-’ in the name suggests, there is
something small on this ichthyosaur: the paddles (see fig. 5; Hulke 1871). 
_Nannopterygius_ has significantly reduced fore- and hindpaddles
(McGowan and Motani 2003).  These contain less than half the number of bones of
other ichthyosaurs.  The humerus of _Nannopterygius_ is also different
from _Ophthalmosaurus_ and _Brachypterygius_: it has only two
distal facets.  These articulate with the radius and ulna (McGowan and Motani
2003).  The single British species, _Nannopterygius enthekiodon_, is
from the Kimmeridgian of Kimmeridge Bay, Dorset (Hulke 1871).

Note the very small paddles compared to the rest of the body. Modified from McGowan and Motani (2003)." %}

## Rationale

Whereas _Ophthalmosaurus_ has a lot of material available,
_Brachypterygius_ and _Nannopterygius_ are known from only a few
good specimens each.  These were described when first found, in the late
19^th^ and early 20^th^ centuries, but briefly, and have
escaped extended descriptions since.  The largest recent work was done by
Angela Kirton (1983) in her PhD thesis but is unpublished.  The recent surge in
ichthyosaur interest, particularly in this millennium, has meant that the need
for definite and accurate descriptions has increased.  This is especially
important for conducting phylogenetic analyses, which is what I will talk about
in my next post.
