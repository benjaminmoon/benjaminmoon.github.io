<p>Here is a review, part one of the year. It was conveniently prepared by Wordpress.com, hence it looks so pretty and shiny and has appeared this year. These are the benchmarks, lets try and smash them over the next twelve months.</p>
<p>The WordPress.com stats helper monkeys prepared a 2012 annual report for this blog.</p>

<p>Here's an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>600 people reached the top of Mt. Everest in 2012. This blog got about <strong>7,100</strong> views in 2012. If every person who reached the top of Mt. Everest viewed this blog, it would have taken 12 years to get that many views.</p></blockquote>
