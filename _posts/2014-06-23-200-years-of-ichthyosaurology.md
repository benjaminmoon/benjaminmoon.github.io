It's been a while … I'm good at this regular blogging idea!

Rest assured that I am still at my PhD, and that the world of ichthyosaurs is
still full of fun and exciting things to see and do. It's just that I've been
heavily invested in a mountain of work that hasn't left me too much time for
anything else … aside from an occasional meal and some sleep.

But on the plus side:

Today is the 200th anniversary of the first description of a (recognisable)
ichthyosaur by Sir Everard Home, published in the _Philosophical
Transactions of the Royal Society_. Surely that deserves a mention and some
form of celebration? (I'm having t-shirts made.) The specimen was first
discovered by Joseph and Mary Anning in 1811, then was sold and eventually made
its way to London, where Home got his hands on it. I mention that it isn't the
first ichthyosaur as some specimens in the Oxford Natural history Museum that
are almost certainly ichthyosaurian were figured by Lhwyd in 1699 (see pls
17–19).

I leave you with an inspirational (yeah, right!) drawing from Home's
description of what is now known as <em>Temnodontosaurus platyodon</em>. There
is more to come soon.
