I've added a  new research page linked from my [homepage](/) and the first thing up is an extended workshop that I ran on [plotting palaeogeographical maps and occurrence data using GPlates, the PBDB, and R](/palaeomap/01-introduction/). Have a look and let me know if you find it useful.

Eventually I'll add more about my research: plans, projects, code, etc.

But for now I wish you a happy start to 2022.
