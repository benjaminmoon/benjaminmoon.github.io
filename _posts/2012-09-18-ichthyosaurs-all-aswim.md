There hasn't been much ichthyosaurs themselves over the past few posts.
So, just to keep you die-hards happy, here's a little montage featuring
a gamut of ichthyosaurs, representative of the major groups. Top left to
bottom right, spiralling in, there are _Utatsusaurus_, _Mixosaurus_
and _Cymbospondylus_ by Nobu Tamura, and _Ophthalmosaurus_ (with some
ammonites) and *Temnodontosaurus* by Dmitry Bogdanov. The original
images were taken from wikipedia.com.
