In my non-working time I'm a musician – playing tuba in a few local orchestras and wind bands, and piano for myself in my room. Of course playing together in groups has not been possible for several months now, but one of Bristol's amateur orchestras – [Brunel Sinfonia](https://www.brunelsinfonia.org.uk) – has been able to organise _lockdown projects_ bringing us together virtually to play some pieces you can see on YouTube. Here are links to a few of these videos.

### Largo from _New World Symphony,_ Antonín Dvořák

### _Danse Macabre,_ Camille Saint-Saëns

### _Theme from ET,_ John Williams

There are some other videos on the [Brunel Sinfonia YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNhGt1V3rYGOpokNEfX_dOQ) – go and have a look to see Elgar's _Serenade for Strings_ and _Nimrod_ from the _Enigma Variations_ – you won't see me in either of those, but there are plans afoot for more lockdown projects in the near future.
