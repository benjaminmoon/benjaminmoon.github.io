In the last post, I detailed a bit about my general writing workflow. I thought
it would be useful to summarise the software that I’ve mentioned and give
a brief description here, with links.

* [Scrivener for Mac](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php): basic
  and simple are the wrong words, but this allows you to focus on writing.
* [Bookends for Mac](http://www.sonnysoftware.com/bookends/bookends.html):
  highly customisable and compatible referencing.
* [Papers for Mac](http://www.papersapp.com): organises my papers life.
* [Mellel](http://www.mellel.com): writer with many writing features.
* [Nisus Writer Pro](http://nisus.com/pro/): writer with many writing features.

Versions for Windows are available for
[Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php?platform=win) and
[Papers](http://www.papersapp.com/windows/)

And my general workflow: Scrivener + Bookends → Mellel + Bookends → Nisus
Writer Pro.

Also, because I thought it would be fun (I am rather odd), I made this post and
the last into a pdf, which you can find here: [Where have
I been.pdf](/assets/pdfs/where-have-i-been1.pdf).
