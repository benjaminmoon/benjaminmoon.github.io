Apologies to those who have read this and want to hear more, I have another
post in the works and plans for others in the future. Keep posted,
especially towards the end of the week!

In the meantime, here is a picture of the ichthyosaur _Grendelius mordax_
from the Kimmeridgian (~155.6–150.8 Ma) of Somerset. It is in Bristol Museum
and Art Galleries (specimen Ce 16696). I think it's so good, I'll use it in
my header!

ichthyosaur (_Grendelius mordax_) from Somerset, UK; housed in Bristol
Museum (Ce 16696). This is a composite photograph so not perfectly joined."

**Edit:** I made a mistake in my naming of the ichthyosaur above. It is
actually _Brachypterygius mordax_. It was renamed from _Grendelius_ to
_Brachypterygius_ by McGowan in 1997 (_Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology_,
**17 (2)**, 428–430).

**Edit**: changed to an updated photo, smoothed edges.
