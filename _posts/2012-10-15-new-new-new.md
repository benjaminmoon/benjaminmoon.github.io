Y'know, it's the same old thing: you wait ages for new ichthyosaurs,
then several come along at once\! I notice this seems to have started
after putting up my [list of
ichthyosaurs](http://ichthyosaurs.wordpress.com/ichthyosaur-palaeontology/ichthyosaur-taxonomy/ "IchthyosaurÂ taxonomy");
just so that I'd have to keep changing it!

This time round, the ichthyosaurs are more exotic than most. Recent
palaeontological research in Spitsbergen, Svalbard has brought up many
finds of marine reptiles. A whole series of papers on Upper Jurassic
strata, especially the SlottsmÃ¸ya formation, has recently been published
in theÂ [*Norwegian Journal of
Geology*](http://www.geologi.no/cgi-bin/geologi/imaker?id=3799 "Norwegian Journal of Geology");Â and
the great thing is, they're all free to access ðŸ˜€!

There are lots to see in this issue, so I'll be back with more to say
once I've taken it all in!
