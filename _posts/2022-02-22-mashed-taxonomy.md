This may be useful sometimes, but in the case of working with species and counting diversity it isn't. Working out how diverse a location is, and how that is changing, is the focus of much modern biological and palaeobiological study. The key is getting the *species* right and working out which specimen belongs to which.

taxonomy | takˈsɒnəmi
: the science of classifying organisms into individual *taxa*, including species, genera, family, and other ranks.

systematics | sɪstəˈmatɪks
: the classification and nomenclature of organisms, and the process of determining relationships between them.

I was led to think about this recently after seeing this paper [@Laboury2022ZJLS] bringing back the ichthyosaur *Temnodontosaurus zetlandicus*. This skull specimen has been sitting in the Sedgwick Museum, Cambridge, and had previously been rolled in with various other species that were never well-known or well described. It's often surprising that, despite over 200 years of discovery since Mary Anning's original find, ichthyosaurs suffer from quite a few problems of their taxonomy.

Part of this may be that so many fossils have been found from a few places: Lyme Regis and Holzmaden being prime examples. Having so many fossils can lead to not seeing the wood for the trees. As animals have natural variation between them (a slightly longer snout, a snorter tail, even an extra bone in the limbs sometimes), more examples means the differences between species become smaller and there's more chance of overlap.

Another reason involves the long history of study and the number of people that have visited the problem. Each may have their own ideas of how to split species and which bits of anatomy are important for doing so, sometimes to the exclusion of other valuable information that is ignored until the next reviser comes along. Either way, the result is lots of names in conflict for certain specimens and a problem of how many species were there really.
