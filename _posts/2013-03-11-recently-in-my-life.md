I haven't posted anything here for a while: second year PhD syndrome has
finally kicked in with a heavier work load. Hopefully this should ease a little
towards and around easter. "But what am I doing", I hear you cry?

In brief, I've been doing a lot of stuff
on [_Ophthalmosaurus_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmosaurus)
especially; visiting [Peterborough
Museum](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=52.57176,-0.2459&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=52.57176,-0.2459
(Peterborough%20Museum%20and%20Art%20Gallery)&amp;t=h) and extending my
description etc. I've also looked at using
[morphometrics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphometrics) to quantify the
disparity in this
genus, [_Brachypterygius_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachypterygius) and
others—I even have a poster on that to present today, although this is
preliminary work.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/ujichth-pco1-2-new.png" alt="Morphometric variation in ichthyosaur limbs" caption="Intraspecific variation of humeri in Upper Jurassic ichthyosaurs, including _Ophthalmosaurus icenicus_ (red), _Brachypterygius extremus_ (blue), _Nannopterygius enthekiodon_ (green) and LEICT G1.2001.016 _Ophthalmosaurus_ sp. (pink)." %}

Elsewhere, my time has been taken up with completing my phylogeny character
list and playing in several concerts. On this topic: I'm excited to say that
I'll be playing tuba in Mahler's Eighth Symphony, the '[Symphony of
a Thousand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._8_%28Mahler%29), in two
weeks, probably the largest piece I'll ever play.

So this is a brief catch-up, just to let you know that I haven't forgotten you.
Plans are afoot and gaining momentum. Until next time.
