<p>It's spring cleaning time, so I've decided to shake up the blog (ha! yes this really is meant to be a blog) and give it a bit of a refresh by changing the design. There are also things that I'm steadily updating.</p>
<p>As always, there are potential future posts and ideas that may come to fruition, and of course, a PhD to finish in the meantime.</p>
