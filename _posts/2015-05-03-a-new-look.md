It's spring cleaning time, so I've decided to shake up the blog (ha! yes this
really is meant to be a blog) and give it a bit of a refresh by changing the
design. There are also things that I'm steadily updating.

As always, there are potential future posts and ideas that may come to
fruition, and of course, a PhD to finish in the meantime.
