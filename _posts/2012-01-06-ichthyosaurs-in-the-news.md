<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>I hope that you have enjoyed/considered/comprehended the last few posts on my PhD plans.  I've tried to explain simply, but some of the concepts are unusual or obscure.  From next week I plan to 'start again' from the basics of palaeontology and then move on to what vertebrates and evolution etc actually are!</p>
<p>Some of you may have noticed <a title="BBC new German ichthyosaur" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16432364" target="_blank">this piece</a> on the BBC news site yesterday.  A new paper, <a title="Acamptonectes paper" href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0029234?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+plosone%2FPLoSONE+%28PLoS+ONE+Alerts%3A+New+Articles%29" target="_blank">published in online journal PLoS ONE</a>, by Fisher <em>et al.</em> has described a new species of ichthyosaur from the Lower Cretaceous (~130 Ma): <em>Acamptonectes densus</em>.  Darren Naish, one of the coauthors, has written about this on his wonderful <a title="Acamptonectes TetZoo" href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/2012/01/03/cretaceous-ichthyosaur-revolution-part-i/" target="_blank">Tetrapod Zoology</a> blog.</p>
<p>The paper also shows that ichthyosaurs were not as strongly affected by the Jurassic–Cretaceous extinction (JCE) as previously thought.  Ophthalmosaurine thunnisaurs (e.g. <em>Ophthalmosaurus</em>) are present either side of the boundary, whereas they were considered to only be present in the Jurassic.</p>
