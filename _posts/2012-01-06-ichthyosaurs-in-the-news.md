Hello there!

I hope that you have enjoyed/considered/comprehended the last few posts
on my PhD plans.  I've tried to explain simply, but some of the concepts
are unusual or obscure.  From next week I plan to 'start again' from the
basics of palaeontology and then move on to what vertebrates and
evolution etc. actually are!

Some of you may have noticed [this
piece](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16432364 "BBC new German ichthyosaur") on
the BBC news site yesterday.  A new paper, [published in online journal
PLoS
ONE](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0029234?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+plosone%2FPLoSONE+%28PLoS+ONE+Alerts%3A+New+Articles%29 "Acamptonectes paper"),
by Fisher et al. has described a new species of ichthyosaur from the
Lower Cretaceous (\~130 Ma): *Acamptonectes densus*.  Darren Naish, one
of the coauthors, has written about this on his wonderful [Tetrapod
Zoology](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/2012/01/03/cretaceous-ichthyosaur-revolution-part-i/ "Acamptonectes TetZoo")
blog.

The paper also shows that ichthyosaurs were not as strongly affected by
the Jurassic–Cretaceous extinction (JCE) as previously thought.
 Ophthalmosaurine thunnisaurs (e.g. *Ophthalmosaurus*) are present
either side of the boundary, whereas they were considered to only be
present in the Jurassic.
