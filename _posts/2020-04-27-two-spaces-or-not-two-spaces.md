I’ve seen
[many](https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/24/21234170/microsoft-word-two-spaces-period-error-correction-great-space-debate)
[people](https://twitter.com/rpancost/status/1253802245784842243?s=20) notice a
change made to Microsoft Word recently: typing two spaces after a full stop (or
period if you’re so inclined) will now be shown as incorrect, with the dreaded
squiggle beneath it, and may be autocorrected to one space. In the strange way
that unexpected things can do, there has been a lot of passion on the two-space
versus one-space debate … debate may be a gracious way to call it though.

Allow me to sum up that _it doesn’t really matter_. Particularly now there are
far more important things to think about, but I am thankful for distraction from
that, and I’m sure others are too. I have to thank my partner, James, for the
title. I wanted to use ‘Are two spaces better than one?’.

I want nonetheless to go down the rabbit hole for the arguments one way or the
other: where does one space or two spaces come from?

Amazingly, but, perhaps, unsurprisingly, [Wikipedia has an
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_spacing) about this very thing,
because the history goes back farther than just using a keyboard with your
typewriter or computer. And the thing about it is that the space between
sentences changes through history.

From the earliest movable typesetting up until the middle of the 20th century,
many, perhaps even most, published works used a small space between words and a
larger space between sentences. The size might not be consistent, varying
between double space to a full em space, but there was more space between
sentences than between words. Except in France…

Well, not just in France, but ‘French spacing’ uses the same space between words
and sentences, and this took off especially in the 20th century.

The summary from
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_sentence_spacing#French_and_English_spacing)
is:

* _French spacing_ inserted spaces around most punctuation marks, but
single-spaced after sentences, colons, and semicolons.
* _English spacing_ removed spaces around most punctuation marks, but
double-spaced after sentences, colons, and semicolons.

With considerable variation.

Typewriters use monospaced fonts, fonts in which all characters have the same
width, and so look monotonous … or whatever the typographic equivalent is.
Picking out the end of sentences with two spaces [makes
sense](https://creativepro.com/double-space-or-not-double-space/) and so was
taught to several generations of typists. I was taught the same when I was at
school, even though I was learning on a computer.

  caption="Typewriter text is monospaced and it became common practice to put
    two spaces at the end of sentences to pick this point out over the spaces
    between words. This text is set in Source Code Pro."

Books and magazines, however, were switching to a small space between sentences
and so this started the trend towards single spacing. Influential books on
typography and style started suggesting, or insisting, on consistent spacing
throughout. One space between sentences became the new normal.

Desktop publishing software will typically just typeset the text as you write
it, but typesetting algorithms, such as used by TeX, still have wider spaces
between sentences, so this hasn’t completely disappeared. I write my PhD thesis
using LuaLaTeX, so had this typographical nicety, among many others, included in
that.

In a roundabout way this can be an example for many things: people don’t like
change, they stick with what they know and were taught, but also that changes
can be forgotten surprisingly quickly. The change from large to small
inter-sentence spacing is a subtle one that happened gradually, but I’ve felt
bigger, sudden changes become ever present quickly too.
