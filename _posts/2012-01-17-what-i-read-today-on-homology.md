Here's something new.  I had planned to read many, many papers early in
PhD, but so far have only managed to read many.  This 'what I read
today' section will hopefully keep me to this.  Here, I will show what I
read today, give a short summary and some of my thoughts.  This likely
to be a more technically worded section, so feel free to simply pass
them by.

**Day One: 17 Jan 2012**

NIXON, K. C. and CARPENTER, J. M. 2011. On homology. *Cladistics*,
**27**, 10 pp., doi: 10.1111/j.1096-0031.2011.00371.x.

  - Homoplasy is non-homology.
  - Homology is the sharing of characters derived from the same
    phylogenetic origin.
  - Homoplasy can be treated as error in the phylogenetic hypothesis of
    homology — i.e. enforcing a separate origin for e.g. bird and insect
    wings (function in flight) or bird and platypus bills (morphology) —
    thus separating homoplasy and analogy in a phylogenetic framework.
  - This applies equally to morphological (characters and states) and
    genomic (position and base) data.
  - Parsimony acts to reduced error (homoplasy) in optimisation.
  - Homology between single-character states is not tested by cladistic
    analysis.

This is an informative paper but sometimes ends up being complicatedly
worded — and has some awfully long sentences.  Aside from this the logic is
fairly easy to follow.  The two main sections of the paper concern the link
between homology and plesiomorphy and homoplasy as error.

Of particular interest to me was the 'homoplasy as error' section.  They
argue that homoplasy is the erroneous treatment of analogous characters
as homologous.  One of the examples used is the wings of insects and
birds: although both have the same function (flight) they have very
different origins (non-homology).  Having a single character ('has
wings') would entail coding both in the positive (1) state.  That
possession of wings is coded in a single character is — at least
implicitly — a phylogenetic hypothesis of their homology.  Multiple
codings — such as 'has insect-type wings' and 'has bird-type wings' in
its simplest form — transforms this into a hypothesis of analogy.
