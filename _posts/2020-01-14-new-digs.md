Hi, it's me again.

I've been busy over the past two years with several ichthyosaur and other
related research things. I thought I'd come back to the blog to refresh and
update and have ended up with a whole new website! In for a penny in for
a pound … as the saying goes.

I've copied across the posts from my old _Ichthyosaurs: a day in the life…_, so
that all remains to see what embarrassments I put down in years gone by. I hope
to continue and add to that from my current and future research, and other
day-to-day interests. I'd like to also add posts and guides on the research
methods themselves, but considering how successful I was at regular or
comprehensible posting in my last blog we'll have to see how well it will go
here.

Suffice to say that this is my new homepage – the home of me. I hope you like
it. Hopefully it will also prove useful for spreading the 'Word of Ben' – or
whatever else I want to say. We'll see what more comes and I hope to have it up
and running well soon.
