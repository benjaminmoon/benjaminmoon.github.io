At the moment, I, and many others, are spending much time indoors. Here in the
UK, the lockdown is likely to continue for some time, in one form or another,
but I'm lucky enough to have surrounded myself with things to keep my interest
and add welcome colour.

Here is a gallery of some of the palaeoart that I  have around my flat. You
might sense the theme of marine reptiles, and ichthyosaurs in particular, which
is surely not surprising. Click through on the thumbnails to see the full
images and I've included links to the artists  below.

  flat. Images are by Bob Nicholls, Mark Witton, Claire Morley, and a clock
  put up by James and Me. Forgive the reflections from the glass: I took these
  photos on a nicely sunny day."

I bought the three paintings at the 2018 PalAss meeting in Bristol, and it took
me about a year to get them framed, but the look great to me, complemented by
coloured mounts.

'[_Cartorhynchus lenticarpus_: walk like an
ichthyosauriform](http://www.markwitton.com/shop/4588356872/cartorhynchus-lenticarpus-walk-like-an-ichthyosauriform/11164779)'
by [Mark Witton](http://www.markwitton.com/home/4552741214) features one of
the  earliest known ichthyosaurs, thought to be amphibious. _Cartorhynchus_
was first described by [Motani _et al._ (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature13866) as the first of series of Chinese
finds from the Early Triassic of short-snouted, 'transitional' early
ichthyosaurs, joined later by _Sclerocormus_ ([Jiang _et al._
2016](https://doi.org/10.1038/srep26232)).

'[_Ophthalmosaurus icenicus_
cruise](http://www.markwitton.com/shop/4588356872/ophthalmosaurus-icenicus-cruise-(2019)/10882135)'
also by Mark is particularly close to me because a major part of my
thesis was describing material of _Ophthalmosaurus icenicus_. Lots of material
has been found throughout the Middle–Late Jurassic making this one of the
best represented ichthyosaurs, although the incomplete specimens meant that
knowledge was difficult to summarise for a long time ([Moon & Kirton
2016](https://doi.org/10.1080/02693445.2016.11963958)).

A scene of the Early Jurassic by [Bob
Nicholls](http://paleocreations.com/index.php), unfortunately I can't remember
the title. Here featuring many different characteristic animals from the Lias
including ammonites and fishes, several ichthyosaurs, pterosaurs, and a large
rhomaleosaur taking over and showing who's boss. The Lias in south-west England
has produced a huge number of different animals, from insects through to ocean
giants, and perhaps has preserved one of the most complete ancient ecosystems in
the UK.

Three posters from the [Virtual Natural History
Museum](https://www.facebook.com/virtualnhm/) have pixel art by [Claire
Morley](https://www.shimmerwitch.space/) that depicts scenes from each of the
geological periods of the last 540 million years. The V-NHM is an ongoing
project, but these tableau show some of the critters backed by the
period-colours and matching style to the museum itself. I sponsored the Jurassic
Period, being my favourite of them all.

And finally my feature-wall-clock, backed in teal and about a metre across, so I
always know how late I am…
