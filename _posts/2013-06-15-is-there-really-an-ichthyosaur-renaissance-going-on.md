The phrase ‘ichthyosaur renaissance’ was one that I first heard at the
Symposium of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Comparative Anatomy in [Lyme Regis,
2011](http://svpca.org/years/2011_lyme_regis/). This came from Darren Naish’s
talk on Robert Appleby’s ichthyosaur work – part of which, on an odd Cretaceous
ichthyosaur from Iraq, has recently been
[published](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/9/4/20130021.short)
(Fischer et al. 2013) and [written
about](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/2013/05/14/malawania-from-iraq/)
on Darren’s blog _Tetrapod Zoology_ – and I’ve used it many times since. So
what does it actually mean?

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2013-06-15-publications.png" alt="Ichthyosaur publications to 2013" caption="Ichthyosaur publications and authors from their first description (Home 1814) through to the present day (halfway through 2013). The basic idea is gently up, flattish then steeply up. I should point out that these are only the ones that I know of and are certainly not all." %}

Many of the large fossil vertebrate groups
– ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs and dinosaurs among them
– have had long histories and many ups and downs. They
were first properly recognised and published upon 199,
192 and 189 years ago respectively (Home 1814; De la
Beche and Conybeare 1821; Buckland 1824) and
immediately captured both geologists’ and the public’s
hearts. From this, there was much study, so that by
the end of the 19^th^ Century the groups were
considered ‘complete’ and any new finds would be
easily fitted in. All three have a noticeable scarcity
of publications between the 1920s through 1960s–70s,
especially compared to the large monographs the late
1800s (e.g. Owen 1881).

However, what has happened in the last 30–40 years is that interest has
returned to the ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs and dinosaurs. In ichthyosaurs, where
this started can be fairly precisely pinpointed to the period 1965–1975 and the
work of Appleby, Mazin, Romer and McGowan in particular. Since then, there has
been a sharp rise in the numbers of publications and authors, such that
publications on ichthyosaurs are approaching, or may have passed, 600 in total
– two-thirds of which were published within the past 45–50 years. Of course,
these are only the ones that I known of, and that certainly is not all.

So in answer to the titular question: yes, there is really an ichthyosaur
renaissance.
