Today was a much simpler affair that yesterday's 'on homology', and as
such is somewhat shorter.

**Day Two: 18 Jan 2012**

MATTHEWS, S. C. 1973. Notes on open nomenclature and on synonymy lists.
*Palaeontology*, **16**, 713–719.

  - Reviews Richter's (1948) nomenclature proposals.
  - These were the additions and placement of characters such as '?',
    'aff.' and 'cf.' in the scientific names of organisms.
  - He also instigated the use of detailed, critical synonymy lists with
    the characters used to represent the status of each.

Much of this paper is purposed as a translation and implementation of
Richter's nomenclature.  The examples used are simple, clear and
concise.  Altogether it is a very useful paper for detailing the use of
this handy system.
