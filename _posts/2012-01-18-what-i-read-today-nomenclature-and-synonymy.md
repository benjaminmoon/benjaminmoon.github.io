<p>Today was a much simpler affair that yesterday's 'on homology', and as such is somewhat shorter.</p>
<p><strong>Day Two: 18 Jan 2012</strong></p>
<p>MATTHEWS, S. C. 1973. Notes on open nomenclature and on synonymy lists. <em>Palaeontology</em>, <strong>16</strong>, 713–719.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reviews Richter's (1948) nomenclature proposals.</li>
<li>These were the additions and placement of characters such as '?', 'aff.' and 'cf.' in the scientific names of organisms.</li>
<li>He also instigated the use of detailed, critical synonymy lists with the characters used to represent the status of each.</li>
</ul>
<div>Much of this paper is purposed as a translation and implementation of Richter's nomenclature.  The examples used are simple, clear and concise.  Altogether it is a very useful paper for detailing the use of this handy system.</div>
