(Well last week actually.)

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/08_ichthyosaurus-2-final.jpg" alt="Giant Triassic ichthyosaur" caption="_Thalattoarchon saurophagis_ looking big mean and ichthyosaurian. Here it’s chasing a smaller mixosaur (e.g. Phalarodon) which has been found nearby. Artwork by Raul Martin." %}

You’re in for a BIG surprise! We may only be in the third week of 2013,
but already there’s some exciting news on the ichthyosaur horizons. Last
Monday (7 January 2013) came the exciting news of a new macro predator;
because adding ‘big’ to the front of ‘predator’ just makes it more
awesome.

So what have we got here. The name pretty much says it all:
*Thalattoarchon saurophagis*, the ‘reptile eating ocean ruler’ (Fröbisch
*et al.* 2013), it doesn’t run off the tongue, but a little skip isn’t
too bad.What we have here is a big and mean beast that could probably
have eating most of the animals around it. There are several reasons why
this find is odd and important: first, how is different to other
ichthyosaurs?

## Om nom nom

[*Thalattoarchon*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalattoarchon "Thalattoarchon – Wikipedia")
is a big ichthyosaur, estimated to be at least 8.6 m. This is a similar
size to the Late
[Triassic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triassic "Triassic")
[*Cymbospondylus*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cymbospondylus "Cymbospondylus – Wikipedia")
and as big as the largest
[*Temnodontosaurus*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temnodontosaurus "Temnodontosaurus – Wikipedia")
from the Early Jurassic. (It does pale in comparison to the largest
[*Shastasaurus*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shastasaurus "Shastasaurus – Wikipedia")
\[~22 m\], but they’re likely in completely different ecologies.)
*Thalattoarchon* has a skull that is around twice the size of a
similarly sized *Cymbospondylus*, and the skull is the real business
end.

In the mouth you find many teeth. With Jurassic ichthyosaurs, I’m used
to dealing with teeth that are a few centimetres long, about one
centimetre across and very smooth all over. *Thalattoarchon* had big
teeth, more than 12 cm for the largest, and these weren’t smooth; they
were equipped (in life) with a pair of sharp slicing edges. This
condition is called bicarinate, literally ‘two-keeled’. It’s found in a
few groups, such as in the crocodilian
[*Rimasuchus*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimasuchus "Rimasuchus – Wikipedia"),
and the mosasaur
[*Hainosaurus*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hainosaurus "Hainosaurus – Wikipedia"),
but infrequent in ichthyosaurs. Some examples of *Temnodontosaurus
platyodon* have them as does the enigmatic
*[Himalayasaurus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shonisaurus "Shonisaurus")
tibetensis*. The shape of the teeth puts it in the ‘cut’ group of
Massare (1987).

## Macro, sch-macro…

So what’s so special about this beast, other than it’s a large,
predatory ichthyosaur with big cutting teeth? Really, you need more than
that?

Besides being a macropredator, *Thalattoarchon saurophagis* has the
distinction of being one of, if not the, earliest macropredatory
tetrapods in the oceans. Tetrapods are vertebrates that have four limbs,
a group made up of amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals, plus a few
others. This notably excludes the fish, which don’t have limbs, but have
many fins instead.

Nowadays, there are two animals that hold the top rung in the oceanic
food chain, the Orca or [Killer
Whale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orca "Killer Whale – Wikipedia")
(tetrapod) and [Great White
Shark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_white_shark "Great white shark")
(fish). In the Cretaceous there were the mosasaur
[*Tylosaurus*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tylosaurus "Tylosaurus – Wikipedia")
(tetrapod) and the ‘bulldog’ fish
[*Xiphactinus*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiphactinus "Xiphactinus – Wikipedia").
*Xiphactinus* has been made famous by the ‘fish in a fish’ fossil: a
*Xiphactinus* was killed eating a fish that was too big. The Jurassic
had the pliosaurs
[*Pliosaurus*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliosaurus "Pliosaurus – Wikipedia")
and
[*Liopleurodon*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liopleurodon "Liopleurodon – Wikipedia")
(both tetrapods), which wasn’t the 25 m in length that *Walking with
Dinosaurs* suggested, although others may have come close. And the
Triassic had *Thalattoarchon*. But what about before then?

Despite there being about 300 million years before *Thalattoarchon*, and
there being tetrapods for ~100 Ma of that, the main threat in the
oceans then were big fishes. The meanest looking was
[*Dunkleosteus*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkleosteus "Dukleosteus – Wikipedia"),
not just because it was up to 10 m long, but also it’s head was covered
in thick bony plates, and its mouth full of slicing bony plates too. The
Devonian (419–358 Ma) is famous for its placoderms, to which
*Dunkleosteus* belongs, the armoured fishes that specialised in bony
defence across their bodies.

## All change at the top

The appearance of *Thalattoarchon saurophagis* marks a change from the
fish-tipped Palaeozoic food webs to the Mesozoic and Cenozoic (including
today) tetrapod-dominated oceans. The end of the Permian (252 Ma) was
marked by the largest mass extinction known; a frequently quoted figure
is 95% of life in the oceans died out. *Thalattoarchon* is from rocks
deposited at least 244 Ma, within 8 Ma of the Permian–Triassic boundary,
and only 4 Ma from the earliest known ichthyosaurs
([_Thaisaurus_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaisaurus "Thaisaurus")
and
[_Utatsusaurus_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utatsusaurus "Utatsusaurus – Wikipedia"); Shikama,
Kamei and Murata 1978; Mazin *et al.* 1991; Nicholls and Brinkman 1993).
This is a very rapid diversification to occupy these vacant niches. The
Triassic in general was an exciting for all marine animals to spread and
colonise new areas, the weirdness of early sauropterygians is a good
example.
