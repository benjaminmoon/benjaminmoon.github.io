This morning has been somewhat of a dinosaur frenzy for me, and yes that
is unusual.  Whilst dinosaurs have been the mainstay of popular natural
history for much of the past 200 years, I’ve always preferred their
marine neighbours, because I think they’re just better (all opinions are
my own and may not reflect truth, although in my mind they do).

Anyway, back to this morning: following my usual routine of looking on
various journal sites for interesting papers, I happened to glance at
the most recent issue of
*[Geology](http://geology.gsapubs.org/ "Geology")* (vol. 40(4)).  This
included three comments, and two replies entitled ‘Direct U–Pb dating of
Cretaceous and Paleocene dinosaur bones, San Juan Basin, New Mexico’.

Now, as any seven-year-old will probably be able to tell you, the
dinosaurs died out at the end of the Cretaceous, at 65.5 ± 0.3 Ma, then
will probably go on the discuss meteorites and other things past the
current scope of this post.  All of these letters are in response to
[Fassett, Heaman and Antonio’s
(2011)](http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/39/2/159.abstract?ijkey=ac2e06ec2185c0209e6c893b838a0499a0352a1b&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha "Fassett, Heaman, Simonetta 2011")
claim that they’ve been able to directly date a dinosaur bone from the
Paleocene (after the K–P mass extinction) at 64.8 ± 0.9 Ma, after a test
on a bone of ‘known’ age (73.6 ±0.9 Ma).  Stop me if you’ve heard this
before ([Fassett
2009](http://palaeo-electronica.org/2009_1/149/index.html "Fassett 2009");
open access :-))…

The method used by Fassett *et al*. to date their samples — uranium–lead
isotope ratios — was the main criticism by the three comments ([Koenig
*et al.*
2012](http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/40/4/e262.full?rss=1 "Koenig et al 2012");
[Ludwig
2012](http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/40/4/e258.full?rss=1 "Ludwig 2012");
[Renne and Goodwin
2012](http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/40/4/e259.full?rss=1 "Renne and Goodwin 2012");
all open access :-)).  This largely centred around the inaccuracy of the
isotopic ratios used (Ludwig 2012) and the seemingly arbitrary selection
of results to give a 70–80 Ma result for one of their samples (Koenig
*et al.* 2012; Ludwig 2012).  The other major problem was that the
intake of uranium or reworking *post mortem* was not considered, thereby
making the calculated ages minimal estimates for the ages of the bones —
which was already very close to the K–P boundary.

Basically, the comments disagree with the precision and accuracy of the
age Fassett *et al.* proposed.

Fassett, Heaman and Simonetti’s replies
(2012[a](http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/40/4/e260.full?rss=1 "Fassett et al 2012"),
[b](http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/40/4/e263.full?rss=1 "Fassett et al 2012b");
open access :-)) acknowledge that their full methodology was not
included in the original article (Fassett, Heaman and Simonetti 2011)
due to the space constraints of the journal itself, although these shall
be discussed in a manuscript in prep.  Fassett *et al.* also decry the
statements of reworking — the samples are from large bones unlikely to
have been reworked, and with mineral signatures unlike  definite
Cretaceous bones — and isotope ratio alteration — intake of isotopes
would have likely been rapid: fossilisation within <100 ka.

So, for Paleocene (just) dinosaurs; the jury’s still out...no?

The second thing that arrive in my feeds, this time from [Dave Hone’s
Archosaur
Musings](http://archosaurmusings.wordpress.com/ "Dave Hone's Archosaur Musings"),
was cell biologist Prof Brian Ford’s article on [why dinosaurs were
aquatic](http://www.labnews.co.uk/features/prehistoric-revolution-2/ "Aquatic dinosaurs")
— news that made it onto Radio 4’s [*Today*
programme](http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9710000/9710630.stm "Today aquatic dinosaurs"). 
Here, Ford brings back the long dispelled notion that dinosaurs were too
massive to walk on land, and so must have required water to support
their bulky bodies.  This is reminiscent of the story of the sauropods
living in lakes (as seen in e.g. *Fantasia*) that almost all
palaeontology textbooks use as an example of how scientists got it
wrong.

On looking at this article, there are many problems, however I feel it
best to say that you should read the comments at the end for more
discussion from more knowledgeable people than me. See also
[here](http://svpow.com/2012/04/03/did-sauropds-support-their-weight-by-living-in-vast-shallow-lakes/#comments "SV-POW aquatic sauropods").

Well, following that foray in dinosaur tribulations; normal service
shall be resumed eventually.
