In the last post, I talked about the British Late Jurassic ichthyosaurs.  This
will make up the first part of my thesis.  The other main part will look at
ichthyosaur phylogeny.  The last part will be about further projects that arise
from these.

* [Part 1:
  a new ichthyosaur](/PhD/my-phd-part-1-a-new-ichthyosaur)
* Part 2: the ichthyosaurs strike back
* [Part 3: the return of
  the ichthyosaurs](/PhD/my-phd-part-3-the-return-of-the-ichthyosaurs/)

## Summary

* Three phylogenetic analyses were published in 1999–2000 (Motani 1999; Maisch
  and Matzke 2000; Sander 2000).
* Though many parts are similar, there are many differences in data and
  results.</li>
* I will carry out an amalgamative analysis of these three studies in a similar
  fashion to Ketchum and Benson’s (2010) study on the Plesiosauria.

First things first: what is phylogeny?

## Phylogeny

Phylogenetics is the study of the relationships between organisms and their
evolutionary paths.  Phylogenetic studies of several taxa measure similarities
between defined characters.  These characters can be morphological — shape of
bones, leaves etc. — or molecular — the sequence of bases in DNA or proteins. 
Proteins and DNA aren’t preserved for more than about 10 000 years.  Studies on
fossil groups thus usually use morphological data.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/Phylo-matrix.jpg" alt="A phylogenetic matrix" caption="Table 1 Data matrix for five taxa (A–E) with 10 characters (1–10). All characters except five are two-state — character five is three-state. Uncertainty is indicated by ‘?’ and missing data by ‘-’." %}

The character data are put into a data matrix.  In table 1, the species
(letters) are in rows, the characters (numerals) in columns.  The coding for
character is given by the numerals in the matrix.  “0”, “1”, “2” etc. for
different character states, “?” is unknown and “-“ means missing data.  The
matrix can then be used for cladistic analysis, usually by software program. 
Cladistic analysis uses shared characters between organisms to work out common
ancestors.  Analyses use parsimony to find the fewest character changes between
taxa.  The hypothetical relationships can then be printed to
a _cladogram_ (fig. 1).

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/cladogram-example.jpg" alt="Example cladogram" caption="Fig. 1 Example cladogram created from the matrix in table 1 using PHYLIP 3.69 (Felsenstein 2009). This analysis shows that E and B are closely related and most derived. Their clade, A and C could not be resolved fully, resulting in a polytomy. D is the least derived. D is the outgroup to all others. Also, A, C and D is the outgroup to B and E." %}

Cladograms show a hypothetical ‘family tree’ for the organisms in the
phylogenetic study.  Each branching shows a _divergence_ from a common
ancestor.  Taxa on adjacent branches are more closely related than those
separated by branches.  Species on the lower branches are the _outgroup_
whereas the inner branches contain the _ingroup_.  Ingroup taxa contain
a character that the outgroup taxa do not — a _synapomorphy_
(_apomorphy_ for a single taxon).  A character shared by the ingroup and
outgroup is a _plesiomorphy_.  The same character evolving separately is
called convergence or _homoplasy_.

## Ichthyosaur phylogeny

At the turn of this millennium, three phylogenies of ichthyosaurs were
published (Motani 1999; Maisch and Matzke 2000; Sander 2000).  These were the
first to look at the whole of the Ichthyosauria/Ichthyopterygia.  Previous
analyses had largely looked at Triassic taxa (e.g. Mazin 1982).

As these analyses were published so close to one another, each did not know of
each other’s work.  Thus, there are differences in the characters and codings
used in these papers.  Maisch and Matzke’s (2000) and Sander’s (2000) papers
were published later enough to allow for comment on Motani’s (1999).  Both of
these compare their results to Motani’s.  However, only Maisch and Matzke noted
the numerous similarities between their characters and those of Motani’s. 
Maisch and Matzke were also able to incorporate characters from Motani that
they did not have.  As is to be expected from three independent analyses, the
results differ in various places (fig. 2).  Maisch (2010) discusses the main
differences between them.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/Ichthyosaur-cladograms-1999–2000.jpg" alt="Ichthyosaur cladograms" caption="Fig. 2 Three phylogenies of ichthyosaurs proposed in 1999–2000. A from Motani (1999), B modified from Sander (2000) and C from Maisch and Matzke (2000). Names on the right indicate the taxa involved in the analysis. Names of clades are given in A and B. Clade number are given at branchings in C. Temno. refers to _Temnodontosaurus_, a Lower Jurassic ichthyosaur." %}

Subsequent descriptions of ichthyosaurs have often included a phylogenetic
analysis.  These are usually based upon Motani’s (1999) analysis, modified to
accept new taxa and character modifications.  The presence of three conflicting
phylogenetic hypotheses is unsettling.  A similar situation was found in the
related Plesiosauria.  These were another Mesozoic marine reptile group,
including the four-flippered plesiosaurs and pliosaurs.  This was recently
discussed by Ketchum and Benson (2010).

Ketchum and Benson (2010) looked at two global scale and 11 small scale
phylogenetic analyses of the Plesiosauria.  Their critical analysis considered:

* Taxa used (66): increased number likely increases the accuracy of the
  phylogenetic hypothesis.
* Characters (178): all characters were re-examined based upon observation.
* Character coding: hierarchical (discrete or ‘conventional’) coding was deemed
  most appropriate; where continuous codings were used, gap-weighting (Thiele
  1993) was use to ‘discretise’ the codings.
* Analysis: the Parsimony Ratchet system of Nixon (1999) was used to allow
  searching through the large matrix; heuristic and consensus searches were
  then completed using PAUP* Version 4.0β10 (Swofford 2002).

My plan is to use similar techniques upon all ichthyosaur cladistic analyses to
date.  The initial study will look to rectify the differences between Motani
(1999), Maisch and Matzke (2000) and Sander (2000).  These incorporate previous
analyses, but I will look at pre-1999 studies to assess the characters that may
have been removed subsequently.  I shall also look at subsequent studies to
assess modifications and the how my amalgamation of Motani, Maisch and Matzke
and Sander affects them.

This concludes the second project within my thesis.  Next time I will look at
the further projects that will result from this, and the previous studies.
