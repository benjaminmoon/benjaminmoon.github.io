As I’m sure some of you may have noticed, I haven’t posted any new
things recently — this month in fact.  It has been quite a busy time:
I’ve taken visits to both London and Dorchester, acquired an
ichthyosaur that I am planning to prepare, and spent an inordinate
amount of time thinking about *cristi supraorbitali* and other obscure
but important ichthyosaur features.

I also think that I have discovered my most favourite ichthyosaur yet:
*Besanosaurus leptorhynchus* from the Middle Triassic (Upper
Anisian–Lower Ladinian) of Besano, northern Italy.  I thank Christiano
Dal Sasso for kindly sending me a copy of his and Giovanni Pinna’s paper
(Dal Sasso and Pinna 1996).  It features the most wonderful map of the
complete specimen (below; from Dal Sasso and Pinna 1996 fig. 8).

In London, I went to the Natural History Museum (NHM), which is a
treasure trove of fossils — a palaeontologist’s paradise.  There I
looked through some of the Kimmeridgian ichthyosaur material (there’s
too much to do in a day\!); particularly looking for bits of
*Nannopterygius*.  Aside from the main skeleton on the wall of the
Marine Reptile Gallery, there is very little material for this genus. 
The isolated hindpaddle was my main concern (below; layout suggested by
[SV-POW](http://svpow.wordpress.com/2011/10/31/xenoposeidon-in-all-its-glory/ "SV-POW: Xenoposeidon in all its glory")),
but there’s also several vertebrae.

Whilst in the NHM, I also took a look through the drawers and found a
nice set of vertebrae, which were unmarked and only partially removed
from their cast, and a very crushed skull of *Aegirosaurus*
‘*Ichthyosaurus’ leptospondylus* from the Solnhofen Limestone of
Germany (Bardet and Fernández 2000): the same place the famous ‘missing
link’ *Archaeopteryx* comes from.
