Twenty-twelve was a big year for ichthyosaurology. For me, it was my first full
academic and calendar years as a PhD student at the University of Bristol
studying ichthyosaurs. It also marks the 15^th^ month of this blog’s existence
and this will be the 35^th^ post. That averages to more than one each month,
which pleases me as there have been many occasions when I didn’t feel that I’ve
lived up to my promises. Not that this means that I have.

So what about now? As this will be one of the first posts of 2013, why not
cover some of my, and (mostly) others, work from the past year, as well as my
plans for the next. Prepare to be dazzled!

## Ichthyosaurs in 2012

The so-called ‘ichthyosaur renaissance’ is continuing in full swing with many
people working on many exciting things. Last year saw new specimens unearthed
and described, and at least five new species and three new genera named
officially: [_Acamptonectes
densus_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acamptonectes) (Fischer et al. 2012),
[_Stenopterygius aaleniensis_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenopterygius)
(Maxwell, Fernández and Schoch 2012), [_Temnodontosaurus
azerguensis_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temnodontosaurus) (Martin et al.
2012), [_Cryopterygius
kristiansenae_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryopterygius) and [_Palvennia
hoybergeti_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palvennia) (Druckenmiller et al.
2012). From all the research that came out last year, here’s a few pieces on
some of the findings.

### _Stenopterygius_ galore

January was a bumper month, and great way to start the year. Erin Maxwell
(2012a, b) published studies on the genus _Stenopterygius_ from the Lower
[Jurassic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic) Posidonienschiefer
([Posidonia Shale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posidonia_Shale)) of
southwestern Germany. _Stenopterygius_ is certainly the most numerous and
probably the most completely known ichthyosaur. Huge amounts of material have
been found of this genus and now fill collections in the Museum für Naturkunde,
Stuttgart, Urwelt-Museum Hauff in Holzmaden and many others besides. Examples
can be seen in Heinrich Mallison's recent post from his [Palaeontology of SW
Germany](http://dinosaurpalaeo.wordpress.com/2013/01/12/palaeontology-of-sw-germany-3-1-11-hauff-ichthyosaurs/)
series. Having such an excellent record lends itself to detailed studies in the
biology of _Stenopterygius_.

#### Species level metrics

{% include figure
image_path="/assets/images/maxwell2012_stenopterygius_morphospace.png"
alt="Morphospace of Stenopterygius" caption="Figure 1. Morphospace plot of
Stenopterygius from the Posidonienschiefer. This shows the distributions of
three species: S. quadriscissus, S. triscissus and S. uniter. Component 1 is
related to size and growth. The starred specimens are embryos (to the left) and
their mothers (to the right). Circled points are type specimens. (From Maxwell
2012a.)" %}

Having so much material available frequently leads to an excess of enthusiasm
in naming species, as has happened so often in ichthyosaurs. Maisch (2008)
cleaned up the taxonomy of _Stenopterygius_ into three species:
_S. quadriscissus>, _S. triscissus_ and _S. uniter_ along with the erection of
[_Hauffiopteryx typicus_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauffiopteryx). The
differences between these species are there, but are often subtle and depend
frequently on the preservation – as in so many fossils. Using morphometrics
– statistical variation in shape – Maxwell (2012a) showed that each species
clearly occupies their own separate morphospace: each species is
morphologically different (fig. 1). The area each species occupies on this
graph also shows the variation within the species. _S. quadriscissus_ is by far
the most common and, as expected, shows the greatest variation, whereas
_S. triscissus_ and _S. uniter_ don’t show as much. The effect of growth from
juveniles to adults can also be seen: the four stars in the _S. quadriscissus_
space mark two specimens of associated adults and juveniles. The large
difference along the _x_-axis shows that size (mostly body length) dominates
this variation, but that other changes (_y_-axis and other components) change
noticeably too.

#### [Aalenian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aalenian) treat

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/maxwelletal2012_stenopterygius_aaleniensis.png" alt="Stenopterygius aaleniensis" caption="Figure 2. _Stenopterygius aaleniensis_ from the Aalenian of southwestern Germany. this shows the unusual preservation where the body is largely seen side-on, but the head and shoulders are face-on. A is the type specimen and B an interpretative drawing. (From Maxwell, Fernández and Schoch 2012.)" %}

The Middle Jurassic (Aalenian–Callovian; 174–163 Ma) is largely devoid of
ichthyosaur fossils worldwide. The Late Callovian [Oxford Clay
Formation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Clay_Formation) is full of
_Ophthalmosaurus_ and ichthyosaurs from the Bajocian–Bathonian (170–166 Ma) of
South America are known (Fernández 1994, 1999). _Stenopterygius aaleniensis_
(the ‘Aalenian _Stenopterygius_ ’) (Maxwell, Fernández and Schoch 2012) is the
first conclusive remains from the Aalenian (174–168 Ma), not just of an
ichthyosaur, but also of a marine reptile generally (i.e. plesiosaurs,
pliosaurs and crocodiles too). This newly described specimen (fig. 2) is found
in a similar area to those from the Posidonienschiefer, albeit in higher
strata. The three-dimensional specimen has its head stuck out at a completely
different angle to the rest of its body, giving a good all-around view; very
important in ichthyosaur taxonomy, but made it difficult to incorporate in the
two-dimensional morphometric study of the Posidonienschiefer _Stenopterygius_
(Maxwell 2012a).

### [Cretaceous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous) ichthyosaurs … “the
Empire strikes back?”

That is the second part of the brilliantly titled article by Zammit (2012)
looking at the diversity of ichthyosaurs in the Cretaceous. For a long time,
there was only one genus
– [_Platypterygius_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platypterygius) – to which
almost all Cretaceous ichthyosaurs were assigned. _Platypterygius_ currently
contains seven or eight species because of this, although more have come and
gone in the past. This is no longer the case: _Platypterygius_ still dominates
the diversity, and is in need of the same type of revision that
_Stenopterygius_ went through recently (Maisch 2008). However, now there are
numerous other genera to accompany it.

This process began relatively recently, with the finding of [_Caypullisaurus
bonapartei_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caypullisaurus) (Fernández 2001,
2007) and more recent reports have increased that with [_Maiaspondylus
lindoei_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maiaspondylus) (Maxwell and Caldwell
2006b), [_Athabascasaurus
bitumineus_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athabascasaurus) (Druckenmiller and
Maxwell 2010), [_Aegirosaurus
leptospondylus_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegirosaurus) (Bardet and
Fernández 2000), [_Sveltonectes
insolitus_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sveltonectes) (Fischer et al. 2011b)
and _Acamptonectes densus_ (Fischer et al. 2012). Along the way material and
descriptions of _Platypterygius_ have also been reviewed and revised (e.g.
Fernández and Aguirre-Urreta 2005; Maxwell and Caldwell 2006a; Kolb and Sander
2009; Maxwell and Kear 2010; Adams and Fiorillo 2011; Fischer 2011; Pardo-Pérez
et al. 2012).

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/fischeretal2012_ophthalmosaurid_jcb_survival.png" alt="Ichthyosaur survival across the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary" caption="Figure 3. Extinction rates and clade generation rates of ophthalmosaurids (an ichthyosaur subgroup) through the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous. The low extinction rates show continuation of taxa across the Jurassic/Cretaceous boundary (orange). In this data there are no new clades (groups) arising after the Late Jurassic. (From Fischer et al. 2012.)" %}

Fischer et al. (2012) discussed the effect of this more recently realised
diversity. Their elegantly simple graphs (fig. 3) show that there is low to no
extinction in ichthyosaur species over the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary
(145 Ma). It’s also apparent that no new clades arose following the
Kimmeridgian/Tithonian either. This implies one or two scenarios:

* Late Jurassic and Cretaceous ichthyosaur lineages had extremely long
  lifespans.
* The lineage and diversity data is incomplete, either due to incorrect
  assignment of species (lumping many together) or through incomplete sampling
  (no one’s bothered to look for any).

The latter of these is mentioned in the body text (Fischer et al. 2012, p. 22),
with particular reference to the ‘wastebasket’ nature of _Platypterygius_ and
the poor rock record of the earliest Cretaceous. However, the conclusion
remains: ichthyosaurs show stability in their diversity over the
Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary and through the earliest Cretaceous. The age-old
question of why they became extinct towards the end of the Cenomanian (94 Ma)
stands.

### A few new specimens

Along with _Stenopterygius aaleniensis_ mentioned above, a few more
ichthyosaurs took their turn in the spotlight. These add to our knowledge about
the occurrences and biology these groups and the ecology they belonged to.

#### Lower Jurassic

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/bennettetal2012_new_ichthyosaurus.png" alt="Ichthyosaurus communis from Charmouth" caption="Figure 4. A new specimen of _Ichthyosaurus communis_ from the Pliensbachian of Charmouth. This is the youngest _I. communis_ known and also shows gut contents. (From Bennett et al. 2012.)" %}

[_Ichthyosaurus communis_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyosaurus) finds
are common along the coast between Lyme Regis and Charmouth (Dorset, UK); at
least common for ichthyosaur finds. The preservation of the material can be
spectacular – close to that seen in the Posidonienschiefer – but all too often
it falls short. A specimen described by Bennett et al. (2012) does look a bit
of a mess (fig. 4), but it’s still an informative mess! This specimen contains
enough detail to be assigned to _I. communis_, making this the youngest
definite example of that taxon. It was found in Pliensbachian age (191–183 Ma)
rocks, whereas _I. communis_ was previously known only from the
Rhaetian–Sinemurian ages (208–191 Ma). There are also a number of fish remains
preserved in the gullet region giving a glimpse of this ichthyosaur’s
lifestyle.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/martinetal2012_temnodontosaurus_azerguensis.png" alt="Temnodontosaurus azerguensis from France." caption="Figure 5. _Temnodontosaurus azerguensis_ from the Toarcian of France. This large ichthyosaur is odd as there are no teeth associated with it, other _Temnodontosaurus_ are well known for having big teeth. (From Martin et al. 2012.)" %}

The new species _Temnodontosaurus azerguensis_ was named based on material from
the Toarcian (183–174 Ma) of France (Martin et al. 2012). Again, this is
another impressive specimen, for its preservation and its size, at the best
part of 8 m long (fig. 5). The Toarcian is the age in which the
Posidonienschiefer was deposited, making this specimen about, but slightly
younger than the – three of the four – _Stenopterygius_ discussed above. As
_Temnodontosaurus_ go, _T. azerguensis_ is weird – which seems to be the fad
for new ichthyosaurs nowadays: weird is good. There were no teeth found with
the specimen and the snout is long and thin and with reduced dental grooves.
This compares with the “large size … and massive dentition” (Martin et al.
2012, p. 1002) usually associated with _Temnodontosaurus_. Being from later in
the Toarcian also means this ichthyosaur is from after the Toarcian Oceanic
Anoxic Event. This ‘stagnation’ of the ocean occurs as oxygen levels in the
ocean fall; fish and invertebrates then die and there is a bloom in decay
bacteria, which then causes a further reduction in oxygen levels. An event like
this leaves its trace in black, organic-rich strata, like the
Posidonienschiefer. Few ichthyosaur remains are known from this time; whether
this new species marks a post-event radiation cannot be determined.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/lomaxmassare2012_leptonectes_embryo.png" alt="An embryo of Leptonectes" caption="Figure 6. An embryo of _Leptonectes_ from Somerset. Young are often identifiable by their large eyes. Several of the embryo’s bones are scattered, and there are vertebrae from the associated adult too. (From Lomax and Massare 2012.)" %}

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/organetal2012_stenopterygius_quadriscissus_birth.png" alt="Stenopterygius birth" caption="Figure 7. A famous _Stenopterygius_ specimen. This is usually interpreted as an adult with a juvenile in the process of being birthed: ichthyosaurs gave birth to live young, as with modern mammals. It is this, among other things, that likely allowed them to become so highly adapted to their marine lifestye. (From Organ et al. 2009.)" %}

While it may not be a new species, coverage of
a [_Leptonectes_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptonectes) with associated
embryos is still exciting (Lomax and Massare 2012) (fig. 6). This was much
closer to (my) home, being found only in Street (Somerset, UK), however the
specimen is housed in the Sedgwick Museum, Cambridge; a little further
a travel. Embryos have been known in ichthyosaurs for a long time (see this
famous _Stenopterygius_ (fig. 7)), but this is the first occurrence in
_Leptonectes_.

#### Upper Jurassic

The Upper Jurassic had a boost in attention towards the end of this year. I’ve
covered the discovery of _Cryopterygius kristiansenae_ and _Palvennia
hoybergeti_ in a post last year (Druckenmiller et al. 2012; ‘In the land of
Svalbard…’). Also published was a description of some new material of
_Arthropterygius_ sp. from Argentina. Curiously,
[_Arthropterygius_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropterygius) was only
previously known from Canada (Maxwell 2010) – several thousand miles away
today, and not much less in the Jurassic. As shocking as this may seem, it
isn’t unheard of: examples of
[_Ophthalmosaurus_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmosaurus) are known the
(western) world over; from England (Seeley 1874; Kirton 1983), Mexico (Buchy
2010) and Argentina (as _Ancanamunia_; Rusconi 1948; Kirton 1983; Fernández and
Maxwell 2012). Modern [Grey Whales](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_whale)
also travel great distances – from their tropical birthing grounds towards the
Arctic for feeding.

#### Palaeobiology

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/rothschildatal2012_decompression_leptonectes.png" alt="An ichthyosaur with the bends" caption="Figure 8. The effects of ‘the bends’ can be seen in the bones of this _Leptonectes tenuirostris_. The bone cells are killed, and the stricture weakened, which causes failure when the bone is loaded. the shaft of the arrow is 40 mm. (From Rothschild, Xiaoting and Martin 2012.)" %}

Besides naming new ichthyosaurs, a few papers discussed the palaeobiology of
these animals both during life and after death. Rothschild, Xiaoting and Martin
(2012) looked at [decompression
syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness) (‘the bends’) in
ichthyosaurs from the Triassic in comparison to post-Triassic. Evidence for the
bends can be seen in the state of the bones of ichthyosaurs: build-up of
nitrogen in the bones blocking blood vessels and killing cells causes
deformities (fig. 8). The findings show that Triassic ichthyosaurs – along with
_Stenopterygius_ – apparently lived a more sedate life than most of their
Jurassic and Cretaceous relatives (see Rothschild, Xiaoting and Martin 2012,
tbl. 1). The authors suggest several reasons for this increase in the bends in
later ichthyosaurs:

* Later ichthyosaurs, particularly the thunniform (tuna-shaped) group are more
  adapted to deep-diving so will be more affected by repeated decompression as
  they surface to breath (Motani, Rothschild and Wahl 1999).
* Triassic ichthyosaurs dominated the top tiers of the food web whereas
  Jurassic and Cretaceous ichthyosaurs faced more predation from sharks,
  pliosaurs and marine crocodiles (Fröbisch et al. 2013).
* Fast-swimming teleost fish evolved in the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous,
  which may have caused more accidental decompression in hunting. This may be
  associated with a more endothermic (‘warm-blooded’) metabolism (Bernard et
  al. 2010).

Incidentally, it was this article, along with its comments and replies (Hayman
2012; Rothschild 2012) that led to John Tennant at [Green Tea and
Velociraptors](http://fossilsandshit.wordpress.com/2012/07/31/deep-diving-dinosaurs-time-to-write-a-letter/)
to write a letter.

Nakajima, Houssaye and Endo (2012, accepted and published online) gave more
insights on early ichthyosaur biology. This study on [_Utatsusaurus
hataii_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utatsusaurus) – one of the earliest and
most basal ichthyopterygians – looked at the bone structure in the ribs and
humeri of two specimens. The results suggest rapid growth and possibly raised
metabolic rates: early in their evolution – and so soon after the
Permo-Triassic extinction event (within 6–8 Ma) – these ichthyosaurs were
already developing the characters that made them successful for 160 Ma. That
_Utatsusaurus_ had paddles and a long, finned tail was already known. The high
growth and metabolic rates, along with spongy inner bone structure, hints at
a pelagic (open ocean) lifestyle and palaeoecology.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/reisdorfetal2012_stenopterygius_exploded.png" alt="An 'exploding' ichthyosaur" caption="Figure 9. The scattered remains of a _Stenopterygius_ from the Posidonienschiefer. Specimens with the bones spread like this are not uncommon. The diffuse substrate and even low-velocity currents are the likely cause of this preservation. (From Reisdorf et al. 2012.)" %}

To conclude the past year in ichthyosaur research, a look at their taphonomy.
This takes us back, as has happened so often this year, to the
Posidonienschiefer and exploding carcasses (Reisdorf et al. 2012). In recent
years, the phenomenon of exploding whale carcasses has gained several hits,
particularly from _Inside Natures’ Giants_ and on YouTube (vid. 1). These
incidences have led to the postulation that some of the scattered ichthyosaur
remains found could be due to this cause (e.g. Böttcher 1989; Martill 1993;
fig. 9). Explosions of carcasses in modern whales tends only to happen when
there’s something around to disturb the carcass – frequently a person with
a harpoon (vid. 1, fig. 10).

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/reisdorfetal2012_exploding_whale_stills.png" alt="Exploding whale carcases" caption="Figure 10. Stills from the above video showing the effect of sticking a pointed stick into a bloated whale. (From Reisdorf et al. 2012.)" %}

The carcass itself will tend to sink and – in deep enough water – the pressure
will prevent explosion. The alternative mechanism Reisdorf et al. (2012)
suggest is the sediments and currents. Slight currents would have been free to
move the bones around in the nebulous ‘soupy substrates’ that made up the
seabed (Martill 1993). Velocities of only 0.2–0.4 m/s (<1 mph; a very slow
walking pace) would’ve be enough to move around the flank and belly ribs and
the paddle bones causing such preservation.

### Conclusions

This concludes my brief (really?) look at the published ichthyosaur research
from 2012, but has not been comprehensive for the amount of research, or the
summaries themselves. Twenty-thirteen has already seen ichthyosaur articles
published (e.g. Fröbisch et al. 2013; Maxwell and Dececchi 2013), preview
manuscripts (e.g. Nakajima, Houssaye and Endo 2012) and more that are currently
in preparation.

## I know what I did last year

From other peoples’ work to what I’ve been doing. As I began with, 2012 was my
first full (calendar) year in my PhD and a year later I feel I’ve made
progress: I’m almost getting to the results stage! My original plans
([here](/posts/phd-part-1/), [here](/posts/phd-part-2/) and
[here](/posts/phd-part-3)) have changed somewhat due to feasibility, time and
material constraints, but the gist remains the same.

### Taxonomy

The largest part of this year has been taken up with describing those
ichthyosaurs from the Middle and Upper Jurassic. Fortunately, I was awarded
several grants from the [Palaeontographical
Society](http://www.palaeosoc.org/site/home/), the [Geological Society of
London], the [Systematics Association](http://www.systass.org) and the [Bob
Savage Memorial Fund](http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/opportunities-savage.html).
This money was spent between August and today on visits to various museums. My
visit to Leicester received its own post, but I also went to the Hunterian
Museum, Glasgow, Sedgwick Museum, Cambridge, University Museum of Natural
History, Oxford and the Natural History Museum, London. I still have to visit
Peterborough Museum in the coming weeks.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/nhm_ophthalmosaurus.png" alt="Ophthalmosaurus at the Natural History Museum" caption=" Figure 11. _Ophthalmosaurus icenicus_ in the main hall at the Natural History Museum, London. This specimen is about 5 m long." %}

All this travelling was, for the most part, in search of as much of the
material of _Ophthalmosaurus_ from the Leeds Collections that I could find.
I’ve only mentioned these collections briefly and they deserve to have more
detail on them: one of my tasks for this year. All this travelling led me to
over 300 specimens referred to _Ophthalmosaurus_, covering every (known) bone
in its body (fig. 11).

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/camsm_grendelius.png" alt="Grendelius at CAMSM" caption="Figure 12. _‘Grendelius’ mordax_ on display in the Sedgwick Museum, Cambridge. the lower jaw is about 1.2 m long." %}

In some select places, particularly the Natural History and Sedgwick museums,
there were those more elusive treats
[_Brachypterygius_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachypterygius) and
[_Nannopterygius_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nannopterygius). In Cambridge,
I came across the giant skull originally named _Grendelius_ (fig. 12) and
London has the difficult to see skeleton of _Nannopterygius_ (fig. 13) This
last is still causing me access problems due to its position (~6 m up on
a wall), but this should hopefully be resolved later this year.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/nhm_nannopterygius.png" alt="Nannopterygius in the Natural History Museum" caption="Figure 13. _Nannopterygius enthekiodon_, the best photo I could in the Natural History Museum, London. The specimen is about 3 m long." %}

The descriptions of these three ichthyosaurs are largely complete in draft
form. The basis was taken from Kirton (1983), as I’ve mentioned before, and
I’ve checked and added much to it. Much that now needs to be done revolves
around editing this into a manuscript, and writing the introductory and
discussion sections.

### Phylogeny

When I haven’t been doing stuff with ichthyosaurs descriptions, I’ve been
working on their relationships. This is continuing as originally planned, and
I now have a set of characters and the first stages of a matrix, which is
progressing well. The collection, comparing and construction of this has been
time consuming because it requires detailed qualitative understanding of the
ichthyosaurs themselves (all 101 species, and counting) and the characters
themselves. Because the characters I’ve collected are derived from several
sources, their purposes and nature can be very different. These wrinkles have
to be resolved before any analysis can take place; this is where I am now.

### Other odd jobs

Much of the studies that I wrote about in ‘[My PhD: Part 3](/posts/phd-part-3)’
require a complete, robust phylogeny; hence have not been properly started yet.
It is also here that some of the greatest changes have happened. I had hoped to
use some three-dimensionally preserved ichthyosaur skulls (e.g. those from
Caine and Benton 2011), CT scanned, as the basis for a finite element analysis
of their jaw mechanics. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of the skulls (50+
elements), the problems of modelling sutures (where these elements meet) and it
taking a long time to build these models, it doesn’t seem feasible to do this
(yet).

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/temnodontosaurus_cfd.png" alt="Computational fluid dynamics" caption="Figure 14. Preliminary fluid dynamics testing. The silhouette is of _Temnodontosaurus_ from Motani (2005)." %}

Instead, following the suggestion of one of my supervisors, Emily Rayfield, I’ve been looking at the related modelling of fluids ([computational fluid dynamics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics)). The idea with this will be to use two-dimensional body silhouettes to look at the efficiency of ichthyosaurs’ motion through the water. This is very much in the designing/planning/guessing stage. I’ve run some preliminary simulations (fig. 14) just to look at how, and if, the model works. Next will be to compare with flume experiments (e.g. Ferry and Lauder 1996) to make the results are realistic. Eventually this can be combined with the phylogeny to see if there are any trends through ichthyosaur evolution.

### Everything else

Outside of my research, 2012 offered the chance to go to several meetings:

* [Big
  Palaeontology](https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/en/Events/Past%20Meeting%20Resources/Big%20Palaeontology%20-%20Lyell%20Meeting%202012)
  was this year’s Lyell Meeting at the Geological Society (29 March), featuring
  talks on topics ranging from specimen databases and virtual palaeontology
  through to fossil code and palaeontology of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage
  Site.
* The [Symposium of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Comparative
  Anatomy](http://www.svpca.org) was held in Oxford (10–15 September), but
  unfortunately I could only spend a day there.

Besides meetings, I also gave a few talks (sorry, these were on my research):

* 29 November: _Large-scale evolutionary trends in ichthyosaurs_, departmental
  presentation; extended for the [West of England Geologists'
  Association](http://www.wega.org.uk) on 15 January 2013.

## Full ahead Cap’n

So what does the year ahead hold for me? Currently I’ve spent the best part of the last month not writing this blog post, and the last two days writing all 3000+ words of it, which has been good for affirming my ability to write (the amount of editing and making images notwithstanding). As last year had much work on the descriptions of _Ophthalmosaurus_, _Brachypterygius_ and _Nannopterygius_, this month I’ve largely put that aside, until after visiting Peterborough. On the other hand, I am in the process of writing a proposal for a _Society of Vertebrate Paleontology Memoir_ I’ve looked at many places to publish, with the criteria of quality, circulation and accessibility (not in that order). PLOS ONE looked promising (thanks to Darren Naish for the suggestion), but unfortunately they just won’t accept monographs (large, complete bodies of work, which this will be). The SVP memoir series offered the best mix of these three criteria; should it be accepted, it will come out in 2014.

I have however picked up on creation the character list and matrix for my phylogeny, looking to complete this within ~two months. So many other things will be born from this and take up so much of the rest of my year – a flurry of projects, as I like to think of it.

With all this work going on and (hopefully) being completed, 2013 is looking like a busy and rewarding year. I am expecting to have my first peer-reviewed publications, first conferences talk(s) and poster(s) and be largely on the way to completing my PhD.

Three years? I can do it in that!

Roll on 2013.
