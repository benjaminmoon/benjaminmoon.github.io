Remember this little critter?

This is the ichthyosaur formerly known as *Grendelius mordax* McGowan, 1976. 
This name comes from the monster Grendel from the Old English epic
*Beowulf*; roughly, it means ‘Grendel-like bite’.  Before 1997, all the
material known of *Grendelius mordax* was a crushed, but pretty nicely
complete skull, and some bits of vertebrae and shoulder girdle; almost
all of which is in the [Sedgwick
Museum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedgwick_Museum_of_Earth_Sciences "Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences"),
Cambridge (see below).

Way back in 1904 (*a*,*b*), Boulenger gave the name *Ichthyosaurus
extremus* to a paddle from the Kimmeridge Clay (Upper Jurassic) of
Weymouth, Dorset, UK.  The shape of the bones, made it obvious that this
was a type of ichthyosaur.  However, its humerus was unusual in joining
to three paddle bones (three distal facets, similar to
*Ophthalmosaurus*): the ulna, radius and intermedium.

What does *Ichthyosaurus extremus* have to do with *Grendelius mordax,*
I hear you cry?

These ichthyosaur names show a good example of how scientific names for
animals change, based on new discoveries.  This is managed by the
[International Commission on Zoological
Nomenclature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Commission_on_Zoological_Nomenclature "International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature")
(ICZN; which can be translated as ‘the Lords of Animal Names’, although
I’d imagine this is the first time it’s happened).  This body has
published guidelines on how to name, write and change names of animals. 
It is the ICZN, following the rules first contrived by Linnaeus, who
requires animal names to contain two parts (binomial nomenclature): a
generic name, e.g. *Ichthyosaurus*, and a specific name, e.g.
*Ichthyosaurus extremus*.  (The genus is the first part, but the species
always contains both.)  Both the species and genus has a unique defining
set of characters, but a genus can have many species, each subtly
different — e.g. *Ichthyosaurus* has *Ichthyosaurus* *communis*,
*Ichthyosaurus* *breviceps*, *Ichthyosaurus conybeari* and more.

Back to *Ichthyosaurus extremus*.  In 1922, Friedrich von Huene wrote a
book about ichthyosaurs.  Here he noted that many ichthyosaurs were
different enough from each other to split them into separate *genera*
(sing. *genus*).  Before, most ichthyosaurs had been put into the genus
*Ichthyosaurus*.  Huene (1922) changed the names of *Ichthyosaurus
enthekiodon* to *Nannopterygius enthekiodon* (Huene 1922, p. 98), based
upon it’s tiny paddles, and *Ichthyosaurus extremus* became
[_Brachypterygius extremus_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachypterygius "Brachypterygius") (Huene 1922, p. 97), for the short and wide paddle.

When the fossil of *Grendelius mordax* above was described and named,
only isolated paddles had been found that were certainly
*Brachypterygius*.  Only a head was known for *Grendelius mordax*, and
so the two were thought to be different, hence the different names.

Then, in 1997, a small note came out in *Journal of Vertebrate
Paleontology* (McGowan 1997).  This showed a new specimen in the Bristol
Museum (Ce 16696); the one in the picture at the top.  As an ichthyosaur
specimen, this is a good example: preserved on its side, substantially
complete with little disruption of the bones.  The skull was prepared,
and upon studying this, Christopher McGowan could confirm it as
*Grendelius mordax* — but now, the skull came complete with a body, and
most importantly: a paddle! (I’m sure you can guess where I’m going
with this.)

Of course, this paddle was characteristic of *Brachypterygius
extremus*.  So this ichthyosaur, with the head of *Grendelius* and the
paddle of *Brachypterygius*, showed that what was thought to be two
different animals were the same.  The problem then was: *what do you
call it?*

This is the treat I spoke of in a previous post. Thanks to Paul for commenting on the labelling — what I had labelled as the angulars are more likely splenials." %}

Fortunately, the ICZN have guidelines for this
too!  Unfortunately (in this case), the rule is that the earliest valid
name has priority — there can be exceptions, as is likely in the case of
*Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*.  *Brachypterygius* is the older name — both
originally and its changing — so *Grendelius* became *Brachypterygius*,
depriving us of such a good name (to save confusion, disused names
cannot be applied to other animals).

What about the species?  Does it become *Brachypterygius extremus*, or
*Brachypterygius mordax*.  McGowan (1997, p. 430) left this unsettled
pending further preparation, study and comparison to the type specimens
of *Brachypterygius extremus* and *Brachypterygius “Grendelius” mordax*.
 In this post, I've left it as _Brachypterygius_ sp., i.e. a species of
*Brachypterygius*.  One of my tasks, as part of my PhD is to take this
on: watch this space…
