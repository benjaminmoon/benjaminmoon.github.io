In this, the final of my original trilogy describing my planned studies, I will
talk about the ‘spin-offs’ from looking at the British genera and phylogeny. 
The other posts are:

* [Part 1:
  a new ichthyosaur](/PhD/my-phd-part-1-a-new-ichthyosaur/)
* [Part 2: the ichthyosaurs
  strike back](/PhD/my-phd-part-2-the-ichthyosaurs-strike-back/)
* Part 3: the return of the ichthyosaurs

This blog will look at two subsequent projects in my thesis.  The first,
a disparity analysis, follows from the descriptive and phylogenetic work.  The
second, biomechanics, follows mainly from the descriptions.

## Summary

* Disparity is the study of variance
    - Ichthyosaurs showed varying levels of disparity through their existence
    - High disparity did not always mean high diversity
* Biomechanics is the study of animal movement
    - Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a powerful tool to study this
    - Studies on skulls can tell a lot about animals’ feeding strategies
    - Ichthyosaurs have yet to be studied using FEA

## Disparity analysis

Disparity is the study of variation within a group of organisms.  This is
different from diversity, which looks at classification and systematics. 
Disparity uses variation to estimate differences in the ecology of an organism:
how it lives in, and interacts with its environment.  The two can be
interlinked — greater disparity may indicate greater diversity, and _vice
versa.  This does not always hold true, and ichthyosaurs, being as odd as
they are, show a good example of this.

Thorne, Ruta and Benton (2011) looked at ichthyosaurs over the
Triassic–Jurassic boundary (TJB; ~200 Ma).  Using morphospace plots — charts
that show morphological variation — they showed that post-TJB ichthyosaurs had
a lower disparity than pre-TJB ichthyosaurs (fig. 1).  The TJB marks the spread
of the thunnisaur (tuna-shaped) ichthyosaurs.

The method used in this type of study is fairly simple: measure various
dimensions of the organisms.  These can include length, width, height, radius,
curvature etc. of individual bones, or body parts.  The data are then compared
using computer algorithms that assess the influence of each aspect of
variation.  This is usually spat out as a matrix of seemingly meaningless
numbers.  These numbers can then be plotted onto morphospace plots.

Usually, these morphospace plots are two-dimensional.  The algorithms produce
variables that show different forms of variation: e.g. longer or shorter, wider
or narrower.  These variables can then be plotted as principle coordinates. 
The two coordinates with the greatest effect or variation are most frequently
chosen.  The data can be further analysed to take all coordinates into
account.  A ‘mean sum of ranges’, for instance, is a simple way to show how
great is the spread (variable).

## Biomechanical studies

As I’m sure many of you will have noticed, animals have a tendency to move
about.  This can be by walking, running, jumping, swimming and flying.  To do
all of these, the animal must use its muscles and skeleton to apply forces
through the feet, tail and arms.  When the animal works harder more force is
applied: e.g. doing a full press-up is more difficult than bending at the
knees.

Using muscles and bones to apply forces, doesn’t just make you move.  The bones
themselves bend slightly too.  The greater the forces, the more the bone is
deformed.  If the force is too great, the bone breaks.  Studies into bone
deformation are one aspect of biomechanics (Rayfield 2007).

In vertebrates, the most interesting applications of biomechanics centre on the
skull.  It is here where eating is done.  Also, the large number of bones in
the skull makes for complicated, and sometimes unexpected, interactions.  As of
writing, there have been no skull-biomechanics studies on ichthyosaurs (that
I’ve found).  My research will hopefully change that.

‘Why should you study skull biomechanics?’ I hear you cry.  The skulls tell us
a lot about how an animal lived.  In particular, what and how it ate and how it
could see.  Sight in ichthyosaurs has been covered by Motani (1999).  Feeding
is usually compared to modern dolphins, including the schooling behaviour. 
Some ichthyosaur fossils have remains of belemnites — relatives of squid with
a hard ‘bullet’ shell — in the stomach region.

Using biomechanics, there have been many changes in perceptions of vertebrate
feeding strategies.  Humphries et al. (2007) showed that pterosaurs
— a group of flying reptiles, extant during the Mesozoic — could not skim
feed.  Skim feeding requires dipping the lower jaw into water then closing the
jaws when food is caught.  A pterosaur that tried to skim feed would probably
break its bill!

Humphries et al. (2007) used a sequence of calculations to predict the
outcome.  A more complex technique used is finite element analysis (FEA).  This
has been used in engineering for many years.  Its use in biology and
palaeontology is more recent.  One of the major proponents is Dr Emily Rayfield
here at the University of Bristol.

FEA uses computer tomography (CT) scans of skulls as a basis model then
overlays a mesh composed of an arbitrary number of fixed points.  This model
can then be put through computer software that applies forces to it.  It
location and direction of the forces is specified, as are any joins, sutures
and pivots.  The stress and strain experienced by the model are then calculated
(fig. 2).

Top diagrams show the fossils. Middle diagrams are the surface mesh, arrows show fulcra. Lower diagrams show stresses under FEA analysis, warmer colours indicate higher forces, arrows show force transferral. Modified from Rayfield (2005)." %}

An advantage of FEA is that it is a more sophisticated technique than simpler
rigid bar calculations.  It takes more account of the object’s shape and the
variations in strength that this causes.  More accurate responses to the
effects of sutures are also possible.  The model and results produced are
generally a more accurate representation of real life.

FEA studies have been used to great effect in studying dinosaurs (Rayfield
2004, 2005; Rayfield et al. 2007).  These have been used to show that
some that some ‘top predators’ (e.g. _Allosaurus_ and
_Tyrannosaurus_) could not use the same strategy in killing prey.
