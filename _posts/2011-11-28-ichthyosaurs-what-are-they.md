Well, I had planned to write once every week or so, but, as you can see, that
hasn’t gone to plan so far.  In theory that should mean that I have
a significant amount to write about now, but…

Since last posting, I have (finally) begun my PhD at Bristol University, and
after two weeks at university I had finally done a plan for my study; at least
the first two years.  I have also completed a funding proposal to the
Palaeontological Association to allow me to visit some museums.  This does mean
that over the past seven weeks I have actually written something down! which
hadn’t happened in the previous four months.  Other than that, most of my time
has been spent finding papers to read, and then reading them.

Now is probably a good time to start going through some of the basics of my
research project.  The title of the project is ‘Ichthyosaurs of the Late
Jurassic’, and I will describe the two main constituents of that title in this
and the next post; starting with ichthyosaurs.

The name ‘ichthyosaur’ (ICK-THEE-o-SAWR) comes from the Greek ‘ichthyos’,
meaning fish, and ‘sauros’, meaning lizard, so they are ‘fish lizards.’  This
name was assigned for this group of animals based upon their striking
similarity to fish (see below).  The group, or clade, to which ichthyosaurs
belong is variously called Ichthyopterygia or Ichthyosauria and contains 49
valid genera and 75 valid species. (Maisch 2010).  As seen from the photo,
ichthyosaurs have an elongate, narrow jaw; occasionally large eyes; four
paddle-like limbs, with the forelimbs larger than the hindlimbs, formed by many
tessellating finger/foot bones; tail fin defined by a ‘kink’ (apex) it the
backbone, with vertebrae on the ventral (frontside) edge (McGowan and Motani
2003).

Ichthyosaurs first appeared in the Lower Triassic (~240 million years ago) as
already specialised aquatic animals, probably also with live birth too.  This
sudden appearance as such a derived animal has led to much debate over
ichthyosaurs origins and how they are related to other vertebrates.  It has
been variously suggested that ichthyosaurs are related to the early amphibians
and turtles before more recently settling upon a diapsid (a group comprising
, among others, lizards, dinosaurs and birds) origin.  Maisch’s (2010) recent
attempt to resolve this using two high profile amniote datasets remains places
Ichthyosauria within diapsids but is not conclusive on the relationships
within.

Triassic ichthyosaurs (e.g. _Mixosaurus_ below, skeletal reconstructions
from Sander (2000)) have been the main focus of ichthyosaurs study over the
past 30 years as new finds, especially from China, have been uncovered.  These
earlier ichthyosaurs, although already highly derived, show a definite
progression of evolution through the Triassic.  The most distinctive
differences are having more similarly sized fore- and hindlimbs and more
elongate tail with less defined apex.

The Triassic ichthyosaurs had a less defined tail fin and more similarly sized paddles. _Mixosaurus cornalianus_ had very long neural spines (above the backbone), a feature characteristic to the species. From Sander (2000)." %}

Following a mass extinction at the end of the Triassic (~200 million years
ago), ichthyosaurs with a different form became dominant.  These thunniform
(literally ‘tuna-shaped’) ichthyosaurs (e.g. _Stenopterygius_ below)
include the famous species _Ichthyosaurus_, from the Lias rocks of Lyme
Regis in Dorset, England, and _Stenopterygius_ from the
Posidonienschiefer of southwest Germany which have both been found in huge
abundances.  The thunniform ichthyosaurs had the more characteristic fusiform
shape, much larger forelimbs and crescent-shaped tail fin.  This morphology is
found in all ichthyosaurs until they became extinct.  In the Early Jurassic
(~200–~170 million years ago) there was a particularly high diversity, although
many of these had a very similar body plan, and so disparity was lower compared
to the Late Triassic (Thorne, Ruta and Benton 2011).

This is very commonly found in quarries and is represented by thousands of specimens. The preservation can be so good that the original skin outline and even some of its structure may be seen. This typical thunniform ichthyosaur shows the fusiform shape, larger forelimb and crescent tail typical of Jurassic and Cretaceous species. From Sander (2000)." %}

In the Middle and Late Jurassic (~170–~145 million years ago) the diversity of
ichthyosaurs decreased: the Late Jurassic hosts only ~7 species.  Many of these
are known only from a few specimens, however _Ophthalmosaurus_ (see
image below), from the Oxfordian (~160–~155 million years ago) of
Europe and America, is know from hundreds of specimens, particularly from the
Leeds collection housed dominantly in the Natural History Museum in London. 
_Ophthalmosaurus_ means ‘eye lizard’ and is so named because it has the
largest eye relative to its body size of any known animal.  The Cretaceous
(144–65.5 million years ago) ichthyosaurs are almost entirely contained within
the genus _Platypterygius_.  This ichthyosaur has been found worldwide,
from Australia to America to the United Kingdom.

_Ophthalmosaurus_ shows much similarity to _Stenopterygius_. The extremely large
eye is characteristic of the genus, although it also features reduced pectoral
and pelvic girdles and is more barrel-chested. From Sander (2000)" %}

The ichthyosaurs became extinct in the middle of the Cretaceous (~90 million
years ago), about 30 million years before the dinosaurs.  The reasons for this
are unknown and has been hotly debated.  At the same time there were many small
extinction events occurring.  Ichthyosaurs were also not very diverse (only
_Platypterygius_ remained).  Competition from other groups had
increased, particularly with the appearance of mosasaurs, which had a somewhat
similar morphology.  It is most like that a combination of these caused the
ichthyosaur’s demise.

This has been a, rather long, summary of ichthyosaur evolution through their
existence.  Hopefully it has been comprehensible and informative.  Soon (and
I mean soon), I will write a basic introduction to geological time (explaining
the difference between Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous).  After that I plan
to describe my PhD plan in more detail and then go on to more specifics of
ichthyosaurs: what we know, what we think we do, and what we simply don’t.
