Dear All…

It's been yet another long while. I put this down to having a thesis to write
(and what a thesis!), and conferences, and travelling, and all those other
things that I've been complaining about for a long time and will continue to do
so … blah blah blah yacketty yacketty.

But this isn't a piece to complain about that. This is about seeing the other
side of the conference hand, and fully appreciating the stupendous hard work
that others have put in to make these great.

Earlier this month, the University of Bristol Palaeobiology Research Group (to
give us our full title) hosted Progressive Palaeontology 2015. This is
a student-led conference that attempts to offer a relaxed space for current
students to present what they're working on, from any area of palaeontology.
After making the, what I subsequently found to be, foolish offer to build the
information and abstract booklet, I was roped into the committee alongside Joe
Keating (the leader), JJ Hill, Chris Rogers (second-in-command), Mark Puttick,
Luke Parry, Max Stockdale, Al Tanner, and Fiona Walker.

We had over 90 people register for the conference, from many institutions, and
four countries. The 26 talks and 24 posters covered various topics from
Triassic tetrapods to alteration of melanin and fossil colour, muscles in
_Psittacosaurus_ to Mesozoic mammal ecology. All talks were excellently
given, and showed a huge variety of topics and methodology; great promise in
these progressives.

After the conference, we had an excellent dinner, and held an auction to
benefit future travel grants for ProgPal. This was overseen by the inimitable
David Button, Esq., who admirably raised the roof, and the price, of artwork,
mugs, and slabs of rock; we made over £700 in total, a monument to the
generosity of those who were there.

The next day, on the field trip, we visited three excellent localities near
Bristol and along the Welsh Marches. With the inimitable David Button, Esq.,
looking resplendent in his guise as union chief, we took in the
Triassic–Jurassic boundary at Aust, finding small fragments that had fallen
down the cliffs from the Rhaetian Bone Bed. Next, we went onto the Silurian
inlier at Usk to capture various brachiopods, bivalves, and even some trilobite
fragments. However, the best find of the day was found after the excellent
pie-pub lunch at The Crown Inn. At a Devonian locality in Crasswall, which
produced many jawless fish fragments, the very lucky Dave Marshall found
a shoulder plate from a large eurypterid; this made Dave a very happy bunny.

So that wraps up a little on what happened over the conference. Besides having
the fun of being at the conference, as I have before, it was also enlightening
to see how much work goes into the preparation of such. While editing, and
chasing after, so many abstracts is not the easiest of jobs, I don’t envy those
who had to deal with rooms and catering and stuff.

Progressive Palaeontology is organised with the help of the [Palaeontological Association](http://www.palass.org), and funding for this year
also came from the [Geological Society of
London](https://www.geolsoc.org.uk). Prizes were donated by [Cambridge University Press](http://www.cambridge.org)
and [Siri Scientific Press](http://www.siriscientificpress.co.uk/Pages/default.aspx), and [Bob Nicholls](http://paleocreations.com), [Luis Rey](http://www.luisrey.ndtilda.co.uk), and [Mark Witton](http://www.markwitton.com). Additionally, the [Paleontological
Society](http://www.paleosoc.org) and [Society of Vertebrate Paleontology](http://vertpaleo.org) donated money towards travel grants. You can find more
information about this year, past years, and the next years (when it comes up)
at the [Progressive Palaeontology website](http://www.palass.org/modules.php?name=propal).
