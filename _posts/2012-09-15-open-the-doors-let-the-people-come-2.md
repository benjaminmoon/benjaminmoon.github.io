<p>A while ago, I promised that I’d talk a bit more about Open Access and the open access movement. Here is the blog post that I finally give to you, a little later than planned, but better than never. Interestingly enough, I’m writing this whilst watching the sun rise (it’s 6:36 am), sitting on a train, heading towards Oxford. This is because I am on my way to <a title="It’s fun to stay at the SVPCA!" href="http://ichthyosaurs.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/its-fun-to-stay-at-the-svpca/">SVPCA</a>, which I will talk about in yet another post. (This may mean that you get three new posts in little over a week! Aren’t you lucky.) I don’t intend to cover this in too much detail as many others have done it better than I could, but a little info shouldn’t go amiss.</p>
<h1>The plight</h1>
<p>When I covered the problems of journal access (see <a title="A shadow grows in Academia" href="http://ichthyosaurs.wordpress.com/2012/05/02/a-shadow-grows-in-academia/" target="_blank"><em>A shadow grows in Academia</em></a>), I mentioned the current model where authors submit their work to a journal, who then charge people to get access to that article. This has been the model for much of the ~350 years that journals have been published, and far before that for academic books.</p>
<p>It’s all well and good (really?), but it does mean that someone has to pay: an individual, maybe £35 per day; institutions, £20 000 per year. That’s a lot of money, especially if you think that a decently reference 10 page article may have over 50 articles cited. It is one of the most annoying things in research to find a not necessarily obscure article I need, only to be presented with a ‘log in’ or ‘please pay to access this material’ dialogue. This is fortunately not too frequent, as the University of Bristol pays a lot of money to avoid that.</p>
<h1>The solution</h1>
<p>The current model, where the reader pays, works well for publishers. The need a .pdf file, a website and a way to get money. The printer and envelope are usual extras. The benefit for them is that they only need a single .pdf file to get a payment each time it is accessed: one author equals many small payments.</p>
<p>Open access switches this. There are two favoured forms, gold and green open access.  In gold, the <em>author</em> pays to publish, the reader does not. The price the author pays is apparently necessary to cover all editing, review, publishing and hosting costs. Green open access retains the reader-pays at the publisher, but also has the article added to an open online repository; post review and editing, but not necessarily formatted. The cost of green is that publishers may require a delay before the article can be added to the open repository.</p>
<h1>The actions</h1>
<p>Some journals are open access; PLOS’s journals are the most oft-cited examples. The author pays to publish, and the world gets to hear their research. PLOS is also different in that it will accept any sound science; other journals worry about ‘impact factor’ which has also been heavily criticised recently.</p>
<p>Earlier this year in the Finch Report, a review of UK research publishing made the recommendation that academics funded by research councils, and thus taxpayers, should make their work available through open access means: the funders can read about what their money has done. It was also suggested that this move could save much money (a <em>lot</em>). The fall out from this is best discussed over at <a title="Reciprocal Space" href="http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/09/05/key-questions-for-open-access-policy-in-the-uk/" target="_blank"><em>Reciprocal Space</em></a>, check it out.</p>
<p>In this modern age of the World Wide Web, digital publishing is becoming the norm. eBooks have become a huge market thanks to eReaders, smartphones and tablet devices. The .pdf file format can be read by virtually every computer, a .pdf reading application being one of the must-haves. Data storage is cheap and easy. The world is rapid and interconnected in a way we didn’t have just 20 (or even 10) years ago.</p>
<p>So why not let everyone use this?</p>
