A while ago, I promised that I’d talk a bit more about Open Access and
the open access movement. Here is the blog post that I finally give to
you, a little later than planned, but better than never. Interestingly
enough, I’m writing this whilst watching the sun rise (it’s 6:36 am),
sitting on a train, heading towards Oxford. This is because I am on my
way to
[SVPCA](http://ichthyosaurs.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/its-fun-to-stay-at-the-svpca/ "It’s fun to stay at the SVPCA!"),
which I will talk about in yet another post. (This may mean that you get
three new posts in little over a week\! Aren’t you lucky.) I don’t
intend to cover this in too much detail as many others have done it
better than I could, but a little info shouldn’t go amiss.

## The plight

When I covered the problems of journal access (see [*A shadow grows in
Academia*](http://ichthyosaurs.wordpress.com/2012/05/02/a-shadow-grows-in-academia/ "A shadow grows in Academia")),
I mentioned the current model where authors submit their work to a
journal, who then charge people to get access to that article. This has
been the model for much of the \~350 years that journals have been
published, and far before that for academic books.

It’s all well and good (really?), but it does mean that someone has to
pay: an individual, maybe £35 per day; institutions, £20 000 per year.
That’s a lot of money, especially if you think that a decently reference
10 page article may have over 50 articles cited. It is one of the most
annoying things in research to find a not necessarily obscure article I
need, only to be presented with a ‘log in’ or ‘please pay to access this
material’ dialogue. This is fortunately not too frequent, as the
University of Bristol pays a lot of money to avoid that.

## The solution

The current model, where the reader pays, works well for publishers. The
need a .pdf file, a website and a way to get money. The printer and
envelope are usual extras. The benefit for them is that they only need a
single .pdf file to get a payment each time it is accessed: one author
equals many small payments.

Open access switches this. There are two favoured forms, gold and green
open access.  In gold, the *author* pays to publish, the reader does
not. The price the author pays is apparently necessary to cover all
editing, review, publishing and hosting costs. Green open access retains
the reader-pays at the publisher, but also has the article added to an
open online repository; post review and editing, but not necessarily
formatted. The cost of green is that publishers may require a delay
before the article can be added to the open repository.

## The actions

Some journals are open access; PLoS’s journals are the most oft-cited
examples. The author pays to publish, and the world gets to hear their
research. PLoS is also different in that it will accept any sound
science; other journals worry about ‘impact factor’ which has also been
heavily criticised recently.

Earlier this year in the Finch Report, a review of UK research
publishing made the recommendation that academics funded by research
councils, and thus taxpayers, should make their work available through
open access means: the funders can read about what their money has done.
It was also suggested that this move could save much money (a *lot*).
The fall out from this is best discussed over at [*Reciprocal
Space*](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/09/05/key-questions-for-open-access-policy-in-the-uk/ "Reciprocal Space"),
check it out.

In this modern age of the World Wide Web, digital publishing is becoming
the norm. eBooks have become a huge market thanks to eReaders,
smartphones and tablet devices. The .pdf file format can be read by
virtually every computer, a .pdf reading application being one of the
must-haves. Data storage is cheap and easy. The world is rapid and
interconnected in a way we didn’t have just 20 (or even 10) years ago.

So why not let everyone use this?
