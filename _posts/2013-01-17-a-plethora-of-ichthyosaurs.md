If you've followed
[dinosaurpalaeo](http://dinosaurpalaeo.wordpress.com "dinosaurpalaeo blog")
like I have, you'll have seen Heinrich Mallison's continuing series on
the palaeontology of SW Germany. The [latest
instalment](http://dinosaurpalaeo.wordpress.com/2013/01/12/palaeontology-of-sw-germany-3-1-11-hauff-ichthyosaurs/ "dinosaurpalaeoâ€“ Palaeontology of SW Germany 3.1.11: Hauff ichthyosaurs"),
published last week, features the
[ichthyosaurs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyosaur "Ichthyosaur")
of the
[Posidonienschiefer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posidonia_Shale "Posidonia Shale"),
as held in the Hauff Museum,
[Holzmaden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holzmaden "Holzmaden"),
Germany. These are some of the best preserved ichthyosaurs in the world,
and Heinrich's photos are excellent. It's well worth a look.

This is a young individual, but exquisitely preserved: all elements in articulation and a preservation of the body outline. Photograph by Heinrich Mallison." %}

Also, for those who remember, I promised a review of last year in my
life and ichthyosaurology. This is in the works, but there was a lot of
news and research to look at. All that I can say is: watch this space\!
