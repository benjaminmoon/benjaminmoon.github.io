*Note to examiners* This chapter is entirely my own work. It is based
upon the unpublished PhD thesis of Dr Angela Kirton (1983), but this
contributed only some of the images used. All specimens, and those
recovered more recently, have been visited and examined by BCM. All text
has been written anew based upon personal observation, with reference
and comparison to Kirton (1983). Illustrations by Dr Kirton have been
included, but completely re-labelled and modified based on the present
interpretations. These have been supplemented by illustrations and
photographs by BCM. This work has been submitted to the journal
*Monographs of the Palaeontographical Society,* and incorporates
comments from two reviewers.

## Abstract

The ichthyosaur material of the British Middle and Upper Jurassic is
revisited and re-described. Three valid species are present:
*Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*, *Brachypterygius extremus*, and
*Nannopterygius enthekiodon*. *Macropterygius* sp. indet., with
affinities to the Platypterygiinae, formerly referred to *Ichthyosaurus
trigonus*, is noted on the basis of humeral material. *Grendelius
mordax* is synonymised with *Brachypterygius extremus*. *Ophthalmosaurus
monocharactus* is synonymised with *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*.
*Ichthyosaurus advena, Ichthyosaurus chalarodeirus,* and *Ichthyosaurus
hygrodeirus* are rejected as *nomina nuda*. *Ichthyosaurus aequalis,
Ichthyosaurus dilatatus, Ichthyosaurus ovalis, Ichthyosaurus
thyreospondylus,* and *Ichthyosaurus trigonus,* are rejected as *nomina
dubia*. The vast majority of remains are from the Oxford Clay and
Kimmeridge Clay formations, but ichthyosaur material is found throughout
the Aalenian--Portlandian interval.

The affinities of *Baptanodon* are considered, and it appears to
represent a species of *Ophthalmosaurus*: *Ophthalmosaurus natans*.
Diagnostic characters are considered important to separate this from
*Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* at only the species level. The
palaeobiogeographical distribution of Ophthalmosauridae suggests an
early Middle Jurassic origin in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, with a
rapid spread to the Tethys Ocean by the Bathonian.
