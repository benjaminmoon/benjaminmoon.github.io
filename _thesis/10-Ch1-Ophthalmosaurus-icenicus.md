Peterborough, UK. Paratype: NHMUK PV R2134, a left forelimb, figured by
@Seeley1874 [pl. 46, fig. 3], from the type locality and horizon. See
[\[OicenicusDiscussion\]](#OicenicusDiscussion){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusDiscussion"} for allocation of these type specimens.

## Referred  Specimens ##

Diagnostic material includes GLAHM V1070, v1611, v1612, v1885, v1916,
v1920; NHMUK PV R2132, r2138, r2149, r2160, r2180, r2181, r2182, r2185,

referable to *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* is listed in
[\[tbl:Oicenicus-specimens\]](#tbl:Oicenicus-specimens){reference-type="ref"
reference="tbl:Oicenicus-specimens"}.

## Diagnosis ##

Maxilla excluded from external naris by lachrymal and premaxilla
(included in *Ophthalmosaurus natans*, *Ophthalmosaurus yasykovi*);
prefrontal contacts external naris but this contact is small (does not
contact in *Ophthalmosaurus natans*); jugal broad and fan-like
anteriorly (tapering in *Ophthalmosaurus natans*, *Ophthalmosaurus
yasykovi*); exoccipitals form more of the dorsoventral margin of the
*foramen magnum* than the supraoccipital (reversed in *Ophthalmosaurus
natans*); teeth strongly ridged (may be smoother in *Ophthalmosaurus
natans*); tooth bases slender and sub-quadrangular (autapomorphy;
rounder in *Ophthalmosaurus natans*; quadrangular and bulbous in
*Brachypterygius, Maiaspondylus, Platypterygius, Undorosaurus*); no
fusion between atlas-axis neural spines (sometimes present in
*Ophthalmosaurus natans*); clavicles meet medially in unfused
interdigitating suture (autapomorphy; fused in *Ophthalmosaurus
natans*); coracoids rounded posteriorly (elongate in *Ophthalmosaurus
yasykovi*; divergent in *Ophthalmosaurus saveljeviensis*); scapula
glenoid contribution larger than coracoid contribution (smaller in
*Ophthalmosaurus natans*); deltopectoral crest as high as the dorsal
trochanter (smaller in *Ophthalmosaurus natans*, *Ophthalmosaurus
yasykovi*).

## Etymology ##

The specific name *icenicus*, from the Latin 'of the Iceni', refers to a
tribe that occupied the type area before and during the Roman conquest
of Britain.

## Occurrence ##

Diagnostic material is known from the Callovian--Tithonian of southern
England, France, and Mexico.

## Discussion ##

@Seeley1874 described material from the Oxford Clay Formation of
Peterborough, in the collection of Mr Charles Leeds as *Ophthalmosaurus
icenicus*. There, Seeley did not mention his earlier description of
Oxford Clay material from the collection of Dr Henry Porter, upon which
he erected *Ichthyosaurus megalodeirus*. This latter material was,
however, not truly described, diagnosed, or figured, and the available
pieces of the specimens were merely listed; this does not fulfil the
requirements for an indication by the International Code of Zoological
Nomenclature (ICZN) article 12.2 ([@ICZN2012 amended 2012]; see also
[\[Imegalodeirus\]](#Imegalodeirus){reference-type="ref"
reference="Imegalodeirus"}). In the original description of
*Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*, @Seeley1874 described two specimens, of
which the first (NHMUK PV R2133) was indicated as "the type of a new
species" [@Seeley1874 p. 699] and should be considered the holotype for
*Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*. This term was not applied to the second
specimen described in that paper (NHMUK PV R2134): Seeley included this
specimen to more clearly show the generic differences of
*Ophthalmosaurus*. Under ICZN Article 72.4.5 and Recommendation 73 d,
this specimen (part of the type series) should be labelled as the
paratype for *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*.

@Lydekker1890 [p. 268] erected *Ophthalmosaurus pleydelli* for a humerus
and presacral vertebral centrum from the Kimmeridge Clay Formation of
Gillingham, Dorset, which were later described by @Mansel-Pleydell1890
(see [\[Opleydelli\]](#Opleydelli){reference-type="ref"
reference="Opleydelli"}). These specimens were associated with further
skull fragments and a vertebra. The humerus was distinguished primarily
by being shorter and having shorter and wider distal facets than in
*Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*. These characters are within the
intraspecific variation found for specimens referred to *Ophthalmosaurus
icenicus*, and so *Ophthalmosaurus pleydelli* may be rejected as a
subjective junior synonym. @Appleby1956 considered *Ophthalmosaurus
pleydelli* to be a junior synonym of either *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*
or *Ophthalmosaurus monocharactus*, and @Kirton1983 considered this a
junior synonym of *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*.

@Appleby1956 [p. 444] separated the holotype (NHMUK PV R2133) coracoids
of *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* and another specimen (LEICT 100'1949/20)
in the New Walk Museum, Leicester, from other coracoids referred to
*Ophthalmosaurus*. These two specimens presented two notches on the
coracoid: an anterolateral notch that is common to Jurassic and
Cretaceous ichthyosaurs, and a second notch in the posterior margin.
@Appleby1956 retained these two specimens in *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*,
and placed the 41 or so specimens with single-notched coracoids in a new
species, *Ophthalmosaurus monocharactus* [Appleby, -@Appleby1956]. As
the number of coracoidal notches was the only diagnostic feature given
by Appleby, the vast majority of specimens previously referred to
*Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*, but without coracoids, could then only be
assigned to *Ophthalmosaurus* sp. However, in the holotype specimen of
*Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*, with both coracoids present, the left
coracoid that @Seeley1874 did not describe and figure is incomplete
posteriorly, while other left-side elements exhibit gross pathology,
especially the scapula, which is strongly disfigured and has become
fused to the left clavicle. Seeley also misorientated the coracoid that
he figured laterally and anteroposteriorly, initially calling it the
right coracoid. This inverted the intercoracoidal and glenoid facets,
resulting in narrow anterior and wider posterior notches, both placed
more medially than in other ichthyosaurs (see
[\[OicenicusCoracoid\]](#OicenicusCoracoid){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusCoracoid"}). A later correction [@Seeley1893 p. 151,
footnote; @Kirton1983] that this should instead be a left coracoid
removed the lateral inversion. The interpretation of @Kirton1983 that
the bone @Seeley1874 [pl. 45, fig. 1] figured should be a right coracoid
in ventral view is followed here as it is consistent with other referred
coracoids that are or were known in articulation: the medial facet is
broader and angled slightly dorsally, and the anteromedial edge bears a
facet for articulation with the interclavicle [@Kirton1983 p. 15; see
[\[OicenicusCoracoid\]](#OicenicusCoracoid){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusCoracoid"}]. @Andrews1910 [p. 46] considered the
posterior notch in the right coracoid of *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* to
be deformation from the pathology affecting the left side of the
pectoral girdle. @Appleby1956 [439], in light of the new specimen LEICT
100'1949/20, regarded the number of notches present to be a valid
character and of taxonomic importance at the specific level. Kirton's
[-@Kirton1983 pp 14--17] discussion of this noted that the posterior
notch [anterior notch of @Seeley1874 pl. 45, fig. 1] has a different
form and placement to the anterior notch in that bone, and to coracoidal
notches present in other ichthyosaur taxa. In particular, the posterior
notch in NHMUK PV R2133 is a deep invagination of the posterior margin,
whereas the anterior notch (although incomplete) is shallower, wider,
and more similar to that seen in other specimens of *Ophthalmosaurus
icenicus*; the same applies to LEICT 100'1949/20. @Kirton1983 [p. 16]
likened this form of the posterior notch more to a "fenestration, or an
incision in the coracoidal plate, rather than being merely an
indentation of the postero-lateral border". Variation in the coracoidal
notching is present both within and between Lower Jurassic ichthyosaur
taxa, as in *Ichthyosaurus* and *Stenopterygius* [Jaekel, -@Jaekel1904]
[@McGowan1974; @McGowan1979]. In specimens of *Stenopterygius* with two
notches, the posterior notch is a wider embayment, like the anterior
notch, rather than the narrower cut into the coracoid seen in NHMUK PV
R2133 and LEICT 100'1949/20. As the coracoids of LEICT 100'1949/20 are
the only parts known from this individual, and they show no clear
deformation, it is uncertain whether the posterior notches here too are
effected by pathology. The evidence supports @Kirton1983 and subsequent
authors, such as @McGowan2003, in regarding *Ophthalmosaurus
monocharactus* as a subjective junior synonym of *Ophthalmosaurus
icenicus*, and this view is followed here
([\[Omonocharactus\]](#Omonocharactus){reference-type="ref"
reference="Omonocharactus"}).

As mentioned in the generic-name discussion above
([\[OphthalmosaurusDiscussion\]](#OphthalmosaurusDiscussion){reference-type="ref"
reference="OphthalmosaurusDiscussion"}), the Upper Jurassic material
from Russia is in need of further detailed study and taxonomic
reappraisal. The specimens upon which these taxa are based are poorly
preserved, leading to their uncertain affinities. *Ophthalmosaurus
undorensis* [Efimov, -@Efimov1991] was erected on a humerus, atlas-axis,
and two vertebral centra. The humerus is consistent with material for
*Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* and so *Ophthalmosaurus undorensis* is
considered a junior subjective synonym of *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*.
The same applies to *Khudiakovia calloviensis* [Arkhangelsky,
-@Arkhangelsky1999], which is known only from forelimb material
[@Arkhangelsky1999]. *Paraophthalmosaurus* (= *Ophthalmosaurus sensu*
[@Maisch2000c]) *saveljeviensis* [Arkhangelsky, -@Arkhangelsky1997] and
*Paraophthalmosaurus saratoviensis* [Arkhangelsky, -@Arkhangelsky1998]
were considered synonymous by @McGowan2003 [p. 127], and a species
*inquirenda*, possibly referable to *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*;
@Maisch2010 retained *Ophthalmosaurus saveljeviensis* as a separate
species. In Arkhangelsky & Zverkov's [-@Arkhangelsky2014] cladistic
analysis, *Paraophthalmosaurus saveljeviensis* and *Paraophthalmosaurus
kabanovi* are recovered as sister taxa within Ophthalmosaurinae, and
separate to *Ophthalmosaurus* (see
[\[OphthalmosaurusDiscussion\]](#OphthalmosaurusDiscussion){reference-type="ref"
reference="OphthalmosaurusDiscussion"}). The four species in *Yasykovia*
were synonymised with *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* by @McGowan2003
[p.113], although @Maisch2000c [@Maisch2010] considered them a single
separate species: *Ophthalmosaurus yasykovi*. While many features are
consistent between the two species, others may be taxonomically
important (e.g. humerus longest/widest proximally, coracoid
proportions). In this case, *Ophthalmosaurus yasykovi* is provisionally
retained as separate from *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*. However,
*'Yasykovia' kabanovi* has been referred to *Paraophthalmosaurus* by
@Arkhangelsky2014.

## Premaxilla ##

The elongate premaxillae form most of the pre-narial rostrum and of the
length of the skull generally
([\[fig:Oicenicus-skull-latdor,fig:Oicenicus-palate,tbl:Oicenicus-skull-measurements\]](#fig:Oicenicus-skull-latdor,fig:Oicenicus-palate,tbl:Oicenicus-skull-measurements){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-skull-latdor,fig:Oicenicus-palate,tbl:Oicenicus-skull-measurements"}).
They are rather low anteriorly, but increase in height posteriorly
towards the contact with the nasals and external naris. In dorsal view,
the anterior portions are nearly straight, but are deflected laterally
in the posterior half, enclosing the nasals dorsally and vomers
ventrally between the two premaxillae. The external surface has a convex
curve dorsally that gives the rostrum a trapezoidal outline when the two
premaxillae are articulated. Each premaxilla is [A]{.sans-serif}-shaped
in cross section; this is produced by combination of the lateral wall
and a medial flange that extends along the whole length of the bone,
bounding the alveolar groove between them. Towards the posterior end of
the premaxilla, the lateral wall and medial flange diverge into two
long, relatively thin projections (lateral and medial), oriented
posteroventrally, holding between them the maxilla, which continues the
alveolar groove posteriorly at this point. These are infrequently
preserved, but are mostly complete in GLAHM V1921 and NHMUK PV R2160.
The lateral wall forms a long process that envelops the maxilla
laterally for much of its length, extending towards, and meeting, the
external naris. Here the process diverges around the anterior margin of
the external naris forming a small, rounded supranarial process and much
larger subnarial process. This subnarial process extends ventral to the
external naris for about one-half of its length, tapering posteriorly
and overlying the lateral face of the maxilla. The medial flange extends
posteriorly between the maxilla and vomer until contacting the internal
naris; the lateral face of this flange forms a small part of the
anteromedial border to the internal naris.

The premaxillae are in contact with each other for much of their dorsal
length, in a simple butt joint. From about two-thirds of the pre-narial
length posteriorly, around half the length of the premaxilla itself, the
nasals are exposed dorsally between the premaxillae, separating the
lateral projections. At this point, @Andrews1910 noted the presence of
an elongate roughened surface that he attributed to ligamentous
connection between the premaxillae. The anterior portions of the two
premaxillae remain separate when articulated; the space left would
likely have been filled with connective tissue. This anterior extension
tapers to a point, both laterally and dorsoventrally, which contradicts
Andrews' [-@Andrews1910 p. 24] description that they "terminate in a
blunt point". This may be because material he studied was not complete
owing to the delicate nature of this area and the portion of unossified
material (e.g.  NHMUK PV R3702; [@Andrews1915]). Each nasal runs in a
groove along its contact on the medial sides of the premaxillae, which
anterior to their dorsal exclusion by the premaxillae, becomes a medial
channel between the contacts of the premaxillae dorsally and alveolar
grooves ventrally. In this channel, ventral to the nasals, run the thin
anterior projections of the vomers, which are applied to the medial side
of the lingual wall for almost its entire length. The vomers are exposed
between the premaxillae for much of its length. The channel is narrowed
anteriorly by the closing dorsal and ventral walls as the premaxilla
becomes lower, but it does not close completely, and feeds into a larger
anterior vacuity that corresponds to the anterior separation of the
premaxillae.

A longitudinal groove runs along much of the lateral surface of the
premaxilla from just anterior to the external naris contact anteriorly,
just dorsal to the alveolar groove. Numerous foramina open onto the
floor of this groove, becoming smaller and more frequent anteriorly. At
its anterior extent, the groove becomes discontinuous and is reduced to
a series of small pits. These foramina connect to a hollow intraosseous
channel that runs along the length of the premaxilla, which also
connects to foramina from the internal surface. These foramina likely
show the passage of nerves and blood vessels that served the external
rostral tissues. The presence of these structures in many ichthyosaurs
led @Romer1968 to suggest the presence of a horny bill, albeit of
unusual type, although he denied the possibility of fleshy lips
[*contra* @Kirton1983]. The presence of such structures however seems
unlikely.

The alveolar groove extends from the anteriormost point of the
premaxilla, and tooth impressions can be seen as shallow, rounded
depressions in its floor separated by low, transverse septa on the
lingual wall between the tooth positions. There may also be grooves
opposite these depressions on the labial wall. These are stronger and
smaller anteriorly; the depressions become more socket-like in this
region indicating the teeth held here were smaller, which is shown well
in NHMUK PV R3893; this feature, alongside the divergence of the
premaxillae anteriorly is unique to *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* among
ichthyosaurs. Tooth impression size increases posteriorly, with the
largest impressions being around the midpoint of the tooth row. When the
two premaxillae are articulated, the lingual wall can be seen ventral to
the labial wall in lateral view and both slope obliquely and laterally.
The relationship between this orientation of the alveolar groove and the
teeth can be seen in NHMUK PV R3893: the tooth bases abut the labial
wall, but the sides lie against the lingual wall. This causes the teeth
to lie at approximately 45° to the vertical, deflected laterally, but
because of their strong lingual curvature (see
[\[OicenicusDentition\]](#OicenicusDentition){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusDentition"}), the crowns are angled at only 20° to
the vertical. The anteriormost teeth are oriented more vertically. At
the contact with the maxilla, the floor of the alveolar groove slopes
posterodorsally to receive the anterior portion of this bone. Although
the tooth placements are poorly defined, it is estimated that the
premaxillae each bore at least 27 teeth.

## Maxilla ##

The maxilla has a complex triangular shape in lateral view but is
largely obscured by the posterior projections of the premaxilla that
surround it laterally and medially
([\[fig:Oicenicus-skull-lat,fig:Oicenicus-palate,tbl:Oicenicus-skull-measurements,pl1\]](#fig:Oicenicus-skull-lat,fig:Oicenicus-palate,tbl:Oicenicus-skull-measurements,pl1){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-skull-lat,fig:Oicenicus-palate,tbl:Oicenicus-skull-measurements,pl1"},
figs 1--3). Dorsally, it is seen as long and narrow as it continues the
alveolar groove posterior to the premaxilla. The anterior process slots
between the posterior projections of the premaxilla and so has a sloping
and tapering anterior process that forms the dorsal floor of the
alveolar groove and contacts the premaxilla on the dorsal and lateral
sides. An elongate facet on the lateral side of this process, which
extends more than one-quarter of the length of the maxilla, shows the
extent of contact with the subnarial process of the premaxilla. The
lateral face of the maxilla is composed of the external lateral wall of
the alveolar groove ventrally, but is extended dorsally into a low
triangular flange, which has an undulating anterior slope and straight,
roughened posterior slope. At the anterior end of this, a small process
is developed, concordant with the dorsal edge of the premaxillary facet
ventrally, that forms the anterior extent of the simple nasal facet; its
delicate nature means this process is infrequently preserved, so its
full extent is uncertain, but this process likely supported the soft
tissues. Posterior to the nasal facet, the dorsal margin of the bone is
smoothed and rounded following the contours of the external naris, and
showing the extent of the participation of the maxilla, although this
would have been obscured laterally by the premaxilla and lachrymal in
life. The posterior two-thirds of the lateral face of this triangular
flange is roughened and ridged showing the great extent of the lachrymal
contact. The dorsal edge here develops several posteriorly directed
peaks that are largely concealed by the overlapping lachrymal. The
posteriormost of these receives the distal tip of the prefrontal
laterally. This coverage by the lachrymal differs from Andrews'
[-@Andrews1910] description: he limited this to a smaller, posterior
portion of the dorsal process and thus allowed the maxilla to contact
the external naris in his lateral view reconstruction (fig. 23). The
extent of roughening on the lateral surface however supports significant
coverage by the lachrymal. The dorsal peak of the maxilla would be
located near a similar peak in the lachrymal in life and these may have
supported the soft tissues of the nasal capsule. Ventral to the
lachrymal facet, the jugal facet is shown by a series of high
longitudinal ridges that extend along much of the posterior half of the
ventral lateral face. The posterior process of the maxilla tapers
posteriorly along this contact.

Internal to the lateral triangular process, a projecting flange forms
the floor of the alveolar groove that is deflected upwards medially as
it contributes to the palatal surface. The anterior portion of this
flange forms the floor of the nasal capsule and shows numerous foramina
in this region. Further foramina penetrate through the floor of the
alveolar groove, and can be seen in ventral view. These maxillary
foramina probably transmitted branches of the inferior orbital artery,
the infraorbital nerve, and the palatal nerve. Contact with the vomers
is made on the anteromedial surface via a shallow longitudinal groove
along the ventral deflection of the medial flange. Posterior to this,
several posteroventrally-deflected tongues of bone are developed that
interlock with the palatine. The posteriormost of these forms the
anterior apex of the subtemporal fenestra. The alveolar groove continues
along much of the length of the maxilla. At its anterior end, the
maxillary contribution is shallow, but the lateral and medial walls
rapidly gain in height. The groove gradually narrows posteriorly through
much of the length of the maxilla, but begins to taper and shallows
rapidly alongside the jugal facet. @Andrews1910 did not consider the
maxilla to be tooth-bearing, but various isolated and articulated
specimens (e.g.  NHMUK PV R3893) show embedded tooth fragments, or
depressions indicating their position, along the whole of the alveolar
groove. The maxillary alveolar groove held teeth more posteriorly than
shown by @Kirton1983 [fig. 9]: GLAHM V1921 bears impressions posteriorly
to the posteriormost point of the alveolar groove. The teeth became
smaller posteriorly as the groove narrowed, shown by the diminishing
size of the impressions.

## Nasal ##

The nasals are elongate, triangular bones that form a major part of the
posterior rostrum and anterior skull roof
([\[fig:Oicenicus-skull-latdor,fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof,pl1\]](#fig:Oicenicus-skull-latdor,fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof,pl1){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-skull-latdor,fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof,pl1"},
figs 4, 5). The anterior processes extend anteriorly for much of the
rostral length, but as they lie in a medial groove of the premaxilla
(see
[\[OicenicusPremaxilla\]](#OicenicusPremaxilla){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusPremaxilla"}), are obscured from dorsal view by the
dorsal wall of this groove. Along their midline, the two nasals meet at
a simple, rounded butt joint. From their anteriormost dorsal exposure,
the nasals separate the posterolateral processes of the two premaxillae.
The dorsolateral wall of the nasal widens and falls ventrally, meeting
the maxilla just anterior to the external naris, posterior to half the
length of the nasal, in a thickened and roughened facet. Just lateral to
the midline, each nasal shows a strong, convex, longitudinal curvature
separating the external surface into dorsally and laterally directed
faces. This continues the squared cross section of the dorsal rostrum
posterior to the premaxillary portion and is particularly strong dorsal
to the external naris, where the curvature is raised dorsal to the level
of the midline. The elongate depression formed between these ridges was
termed the *excavatio internasalis* by @Maisch1997e. There is no
evidence for an internasal foramen. The function of this depression is
uncertain; @Wade1984 suggested it may be the locus for an organ for
echolocation, similar to the melon in cetaceans. @Maisch2000c disputed
this as the structure of the otic capsule bears little resemblance to
that in Cetacea, and the *excavatio internasalis* is much smaller,
suggesting an olfactory function instead. The posterior dorsal surface
is largely flattened and dorsally deflected, giving the skull roof a
distinct curve dorsal to and around the large orbit. As an internasal
foramen is not present in *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*, nor other
ichthyosaur taxa that have an *excavatio internasalis*, an olfactory
function is also unlikely. The strong dorsal inflection of the skull
around the orbit would have been a region that experienced forces from
several directions, such as the drag forces from forward swimming and
the compressive forces on the snout during biting, requiring
strengthening at this point of the snout. Additionally, to increase the
streamlining of the skull about the external naris and orbit, the dorsal
nasal bone may have been fluted, and the *excavatio internasalis* may
have been fat-filled to reduce the angular displacement caused by the
orbit. Posteriorly, the nasal overlaps the frontal dorsally and
postfrontal laterally respectively in an interdigitating suture, the
nasal plate thinning in this region. The ventral margin abuts the
prefrontal posterior to its participation in the external narial
opening, excluding the nasal from external contact with the lachrymal.
Evidence from NHMUK PV R4758 suggests that the lachrymal does not
contact the ventral margin of the nasal but is excluded by the narial
process of the prefrontal [@Kirton1983]. The facet identified as the
lachrymal facet by @Andrews1910 may be the posterior portion of the
lateral flared edge (see below), which is frequently damaged. Ventrally,
the nasal is concave with a low and wide groove along much of the
anterior process, extending and tapering until medial to the external
naris. The external naris opens into a low, posteriorly oriented
channel. Posterior to this, the extensive contact with the frontal
covers much of the remaining surface.

The ventral border of the nasal, just posterior to its midpoint, forms
much of the dorsal border of the external naris. This border has two
parts: the anterior is a short, smooth, and thin vertical edge. Behind
this is a smooth, straight, horizontal margin that, posteriorly, is
projected laterally into a flared edge, which curves ventrally towards
the posterior of the external narial opening, forming a funnel, as noted
by @Andrews1910. This lateral expansion is rarely completely preserved;
it was probably formed from very thin bone in life. A small spur of bone
is sometimes developed just internal to the narial opening that is
visible in lateral view, between the two portions of the border.
Posterior to the lateral expansion, there may also be a small notch, as
is developed in GLAHM V1129 and to a lesser extent in NHMUK PV R4753. In
specimens where this notch is not seen, the external bone is pierced by
one or more foramina (e.g.  PETMG R47). These structures likely indicate
the passage of vessels for the soft tissues of the nasal capsule. The
bony structures of the maxilla, lachrymal, and nasal do not permit
reconstruction of these tissues, but suggest the presence of muscular
structures that may be associated with a valvular mechanism
[@Parsons1970; @Kirton1983; @Maisch2000c].

## Lachrymal ##

This thin plate of bone is positioned lateral to the maxilla, covering
much of its lateral surface
([\[fig:Oicenicus-skull-dor,pl1\]](#fig:Oicenicus-skull-dor,pl1){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-skull-dor,pl1"}, figs 4, 5). The lachrymal has
a triangular shape, extending in three directions: anterior, dorsal, and
posteroventral. Its anterior portion forms the ventral and posterior
margin of the external naris with its smooth and rounded dorsal border.
This is largely horizontal, but a low prominence is developed towards
the posterior part of the margin, and just posterior to the dorsal tip
of the maxilla, which can be seen interior to the lachrymal in lateral
view. The anteriormost tip of the lachrymal has a small contact with the
premaxilla on its ventral edge. Laterally, its face is largely smooth,
but develops a crescentic ridge that follows the orbital border on its
posterior margin. Anteriorly, this is perforated by numerous nutritive
foramina. The ridge is continued around the orbit dorsally by the
prefrontal, postfrontal and postorbital leading @Kirton1983 to suggest
that it supported a thickened dermis that protected the eye. The dorsal
process contacts the narial process of the prefrontal at its apex in an
interdigitating suture, excluding contact with the nasal ([@Kirton1983];
*contra* [@Andrews1910]). The narial process of the prefrontal extends
ventrally to cover much of the medial face of the lachrymal.
Posteroventrally, the lachrymal is drawn out into a long process that
follows the dorsal edge of the maxilla. This process becomes wider
posteriorly and develops a ventral groove that contacts the jugal. In
this region, the lachrymal, maxilla, and jugal together form the
anteroventral margin of the orbit. Medially, longitudinally directed low
ridges that form the contact with the maxilla largely cover the face of
the lachrymal.

## External Naris ##

The external naris is bordered by the maxilla, lachrymal and nasal in
*Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* with its form described above
([\[fig:Oicenicus-skull-latdor\]](#fig:Oicenicus-skull-latdor){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-skull-latdor"}). Additionally, it is located
laterally on the skull of *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*, reflecting the
square cross section of the jaws and strong dorsolateral curvature of
the nasals (see
[\[OicenicusNasal\]](#OicenicusNasal){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusNasal"}), so little of the naris is visible in
dorsal view.

## Prefrontal ##

The prefrontal has little exposure on the skull roof, which belies its
complex form
([\[fig:Oicenicus-skull-latdor,fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof,pl2\]](#fig:Oicenicus-skull-latdor,fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof,pl2){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-skull-latdor,fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof,pl2"},
figs 1, 2). It is composed of a dorsal sheet and an anteroventrally
directed strut that forms the anterodorsal margin of the orbit. The
anterior portion of this rounded strut contacts the lachrymal at the
posterodorsal margin of the external naris in a strong interlocking
facet, underlapping its medial surface on much of the dorsal process and
extending to contact the maxilla distally. This extensive contact acted
as a strong columnar support between the external naris and orbit,
resisting strong compressive forces generated during feeding
[@Kirton1983]. The strut thickens dorsally and gently curves
posterodorsally around the orbit. Towards the main body of the bone,
this strut widens, forming lateral and medial flanges that merge into
the expanded dorsal sheet. The lateral flange is the smaller and is
exposed in dorsal view; this forms part of the supraorbital ridge that
can be seen around much of the orbit (see
[\[OicenicusOrbitalfenestra\]](#OicenicusOrbitalfenestra){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusOrbitalfenestra"}), and links those on the lachrymal
anteriorly and postfrontal posteriorly. The medial flange is slightly
larger and is ridged dorsally. It contacts the nasal and the frontal
ventrally. Along the main axis of the dorsal surface of the prefrontal
is a parabolic ridge that meets a deep groove in the lateral margin of
the overlapping nasal. The posterior part of the prefrontal is covered
by the postfrontal dorsally and overlaps a small part of the parietal
posteromedially. Here the prefrontal tapers posteriorly beneath the
frontal and postfrontal contacting the anteromedial apex of the
supratemporal fenestra and the parietal. Ventrally, between the dorsal
sheet and the medial side of the central strut, the prefrontal takes
part in a rounded depression that is continued by the ventral surfaces
of the frontal and parietal. @Kirton1983 suggested that this feature
marks the location of the olfactory lobes of the brain.

## Frontal ##

These are small bones of the skull roof, with a correspondingly small
exposure dorsally
([\[fig:Oicenicus-skull-dor,fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof\]](#fig:Oicenicus-skull-dor,fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-skull-dor,fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof"}).
The frontals are surrounded by the nasals, postfrontals, and parietals;
anteriorly, laterally, and posteriorly, respectively. Contacts
superficially appear to be interdigitating sutures, belying the
extensive overlap of the bones in this region. This covering, and the
delicacy of the bone, makes description problematic as the frontal is
often preserved in articulation and so is poorly visible, hence Andrews'
[-@Andrews1910] trifling description. The exposed dorsal surface is
largely flat, but is pitted by numerous foramina that @Kirton1983
interpreted as indicating close application of the dermis. Medially, the
frontals meet in a straight suture that is broadened dorsoventrally by a
ventral deflection of the ventral surface, possibly providing a large
surface for bonding by connective tissue [@Kirton1983]. The ventral
ridge formed by this ventral deflection marks the medial border between
two interior depressions on the ventral skull roof, indication the
extent of the telencephalon, which is continued from the prefrontal
([\[OicenicusPrefrontal,fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof\]](#OicenicusPrefrontal,fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusPrefrontal,fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof"}). At the
posterior end of the medial suture, the frontals enclose almost the
entirety of the pineal foramen in dorsal view, the parietals forming
only the posteriormost portion of its margin. The pineal foramen is
ovoid, pinched at the anterior and posterior, and the frontals are
smoothed around the margins. Anteriorly, the nasal overlaps the frontal
extensively, so the latter's surface is ridged and grooved in this
region.

Ventrally, the frontal is dominated by the depression accommodating the
dorsal structures of the brain [@Kirton1983] that are continuous with
those of the nasal anteriorly, prefrontal laterally, and parietal
posteriorly. The medial flange of the prefrontal underlaps the frontal
laterally; this is obscured from dorsal view by the overlapping nasal
and postfrontal. A small contact is made with the postfrontal by
interlocking tongues at the posterolateral extent of the frontal. The
posterior portion of the ventral surface of the frontal is ridged and
contacts the underlapping parietal. The contact between the parietal and
postfrontal excludes the frontal from the margin of the supratemporal
fenestra dorsally, while the posterior extent of the prefrontal-parietal
contact excludes the frontal ventrally.

## Parietal ##

These paired bones form the posteromedial portion of the skull roof and
much of the medial border of the supratemporal fenestra
([\[fig:Oicenicus-skull-dor,fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof,pl3\]](#fig:Oicenicus-skull-dor,fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof,pl3){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-skull-dor,fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof,pl3"}).
The parietal has a generally crescentic shape, with a large anterior
main body and a robust posterolateral process. The anterior region of
the parietal is overlapped by the frontal giving an interdigitating
suture line with ridges and grooves on the dorsal surface. The two
parietals meet medially along much of their midline, although their
anteriormost sections rapidly diverge around the pineal foramen and
under the frontals. The medial suture between the parietals is straight
and dorsoventrally thickened, with complex grooves along its medial
surface. Lateral to this, much of the dorsal surface of the parietal is
largely convex, with the lateral edge curving ventral to form the smooth
medial wall of the supratemporal fenestra. Posteriorly, there is a small
rise towards the posterolateral process and there, medial to the
processes themselves, the parietal forms a small shelf, under which the
supraoccipital fits. The posterolateral process descends laterally along
its length to underlie the supratemporal. At its midpoint, the lateral
wall of the parietal is drawn ventrally into a pointed descending
process that may have contacted the epipterygoid, as occurs in
*Ichthyosaurus* [@McGowan1973; @Kirton1983]. It is likely that the
epipterygoid was not ossified in *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* (see
[\[OicenicusEpipterygoid\]](#OicenicusEpipterygoid){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusEpipterygoid"}). @Andrews1910 interpreted a deeply
grooved region just anterior to this process as the facet for the
epipterygoid (*columella cranii*). @Kirton1983, however, suggested this
was instead a point of muscle attachment (*M. levator pterygoidei?*),
when compared with *Ichthyosaurus*. This groove is more likely the facet
for the epipterygoid, which, although unlikely to be ossified
([\[OicenicusEpipterygoid\]](#OicenicusEpipterygoid){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusEpipterygoid"}), may have remained in cartilaginous
form, as has been argued for *Platypterygius australis* [@Kear2005a
599]. The groove also corresponds to the epipterygoid facet described by
@McGowan1973 [26].

Like the frontal, the ventral surface of the parietal shows evidence of
moulding to accommodate the underlying structures of the brain.
Laterally, the anterior parietal continues the longitudinal depression
found on the frontal and prefrontal that @Kirton1983 interpreted as the
impression of the olfactory lobe (see
[\[OicenicusPrefrontal,OicenicusFrontal\]](#OicenicusPrefrontal,OicenicusFrontal){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusPrefrontal,OicenicusFrontal"}). Posteriorly, and
more medially, a further faint depression may house the cerebral
hemisphere [@McGowan1973; @Kirton1983]. These anterior depressions are
marked by faint striae. The posterior extent of these depressions is
marked by a transverse ridge ["tentorial ridge" of @Andrews1910
fig. 14]. Posterior to this is a large rounded depression that is
bounded anteriorly by the transverse ridge and the descending process
laterally. The surface here is irregular and marked by numerous striae
that radiate from the centre of the depression. Kirton ([-@Kirton1983];
after [@McGowan1973]) interpreted this depression as the location of the
optic lobe of the mesencephalon. The ventral surface of the
posterolateral process is concave, bordered by an anterior ridge, which
marks the posteromedial wall of the supratemporal fenestra, and a
posterior ridge that marks the parietal shelf. This latter may be
grooved to accommodate the dorsal ridge of the underlying supraoccipital
(see
[\[OicenicusSupraoccipital\]](#OicenicusSupraoccipital){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusSupraoccipital"}), although a significant amount of
cartilage may have intervened as the supraoccipital is positioned
ventral to the parietal. The ventral surface forms the roof of a narrow
opening equivalent to the posttemporal fenestra of primitive tetrapods,
between the parietal dorsally, the supraoccipital posteroventrally, and
the squamosal laterally [@Evans2008].

The position of the parietal means that numerous bones surround it.
Anteriorly, the frontal overlaps by interlocking suture, as seen in
dorsal view
([\[fig:Oicenicus-skull-dor,fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof\]](#fig:Oicenicus-skull-dor,fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-skull-dor,fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof"}).
The anterolateral margin of the parietal contacts the prefrontal and
postfrontal bones. The prefrontal slots between two laminae of the
parietal in its anterolateral corner
([\[fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof\]](#fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof"}). The ventral lamina is
drawn into a long delicate process that runs along the orbital ridge of
the ventral surface of the prefrontal
([\[fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof\]](#fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof"}), which is often broken.
Contact with the postfrontal is smaller: the parietal has a small facet
on its dorsal surface onto which the postfrontal abuts; this is obscured
by the overlying frontal. The posterolateral process of the parietal
meets and underlaps the supratemporal in a series of well-developed
ridges and grooves that strengthen this contact.

## Postfrontal ##

This curved and thickened bone forms the anterolateral border of the
supratemporal fenestra, the lateral portion of the skull roof and the
dorsal wall of the orbit
([\[fig:Oicenicus-skull-latdor,fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof,pl2\]](#fig:Oicenicus-skull-latdor,fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof,pl2){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-skull-latdor,fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof,pl2"},
figs 3, 4). The postfrontal is [L]{.sans-serif}-shaped in dorsal view,
with a wide anterior plate that grades into a more mediolaterally facing
posterior strut. A small area of the anterior postfrontal is grooved,
marking the extent of interdigitation with the nasal anteriorly and
frontal anteromedially. @Appleby1956 noted that the postfrontal overlaps
all other bones in its anterior region. Posteriorly, the dorsal surface
is largely smooth. The medial border is rounded and roughened, with
numerous nutritive foramina, which @Kirton1983 suggested might have been
the origin of part of the *M. adductor mandibulae externus*. Lateral to
this, the postfrontal slopes downwards towards the lateral margin of the
skull; the whole bone tapers in this direction. Both @Andrews1910 and
@Appleby1956 commented on the thinness of the lateral flange.

Ventrally, the anterior part of the postfrontal overlies the prefrontal
for much of its area via a strongly grooved contact. A small
anteromedial facet receives and overlaps the parietal. Posterior to this
area, the ventral surface is raised into a longitudinal ridge that marks
the dorsal rim of the orbit, continued from the prefrontal anteriorly
towards the postorbital posteriorly. This ridge is positioned towards
the medial edge of the postfrontal, so that there is a steep slope up
towards the supratemporal fenestra medially and a gentler, concave curve
that marks the lateral flange of the postfrontal. The lateral flange is
the dorsal portion of the supraorbital crest (see
[\[OicenicusOrbitalfenestra\]](#OicenicusOrbitalfenestra){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusOrbitalfenestra"}). The posterior portion of the
postfrontal is greatly overlapped by the supratemporal. An elongate
groove extends along about one-half the length of medial margin of the
postfrontal, into which a long medial tongue of bone from the
supratemporal slots. The posterior edge of the postfrontal itself
develops two blunt tongues, dorsally and ventrally. The former overlaps
the lateral face of the supratemporal and the latter meets the
postorbital in a slot. A groove on the posterolateral edge of the
postfrontal receives a tongue of bone from the postorbital.

## Supratemporal ##

The triradiate supratemporal forms the posterolateral margin of both the
supratemporal fenestra and the skull roof as a whole
([\[fig:Oicenicus-skull-latdor,fig:Oicenicus-occipital,pl2\]](#fig:Oicenicus-skull-latdor,fig:Oicenicus-occipital,pl2){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-skull-latdor,fig:Oicenicus-occipital,pl2"},
figs 5--8). The main body is located at the posterolateral corner of the
cranium and its three rami are directed anteriorly, along the lateral
skull roof, medially, along the posterodorsal margin of the skull, and
ventrally, medial to the quadrate. The anterior and ventral rami consist
of thin sheets of bone that are often broken, but NHMUK PV R2146
preserves much of the supratemporal. Much of the lateral wall of the
supratemporal fenestra is formed by the anterior ramus, which has a
rounded dorsal margin and narrows anteriorly to contact the postfrontal.
The dorsal part of this ramus is a thick and rounded bar. There is a
deep groove dorsolaterally with which a ventral groove on the
postfrontal interlocks (see
[\[OicenicusPostfrontal\]](#OicenicusPostfrontal){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusPostfrontal"}) strengthening this point of the
supratemporal fenestra [@Kirton1983]. Ventral to the bar, the anterior
ramus develops a broad but thin sheet, deepening posteriorly, against
which the squamosal superficially lies laterally, marked dorsally by a
shallow groove. The squamosal also meets a facet at the posteroventral
margin, and the supratemporal is thickened and roughened for this
contact. On its medial face, the anterior ramus of the supratemporal is
roughened dorsally for muscle attachment; @Kirton1983 suggested that the
*M. adductor mandibulae externus* would have attached along most of the
lateral supratemporal fenestra. The ventral margin of the supratemporal
is underlapped by the postorbital anterior to its contact with the
squamosal and is also roughened.

The medial ramus is triangular in shape and consists of a thickened bar
that rises anteromedially. A large, concave, triangular or "somewhat
diamond-shaped" [@Andrews1910 16] facet at its medial end is the main
contact with the parietal, and is strongly grooved. On the ventral
surface of this ramus, there are two deep grooves that receive
particularly prominent ridges from the parietal. The supratemporal
overlaps the lateral process of the parietal anterodorsally, tapering
anteriorly along this process. This anterior orientation creates a
noticeably acute angle at the posterolateral corner of the supratemporal
fenestra between the anterior and medial rami. Externally, the surface
of the anterior and medial rami have striations that meet at the
posterolateral corner of the bone in a roughened area. On the dorsal
part of the posterior surface of the supratemporal, there is a small
horizontal, triangular shelf that becomes deeper medially and may be
grooved dorsally (e.g.  NHMUK PV R2146). Ventrally to this, there is a
small depression that marks the facet for the paroccipital process of
the opisthotic. @Appleby1956 [p. 413], however, suggested this process
articulated more medially at the apex between the medial and ventral
rami. This paroccipital process of the opisthotic is received between
the ventral surface of the horizontal shelf and the main bone, but is
poorly developed except in the most well-ossified specimens (e.g.  NHMUK
PV R2133, R4753). In these cases it can be seen to comprise two separate
facets: one on the ventral surface of the shelf and a smaller facet on
the main body of the supratemporal. There is a prominent tubercle in the
middle of the posterior face that @Kirton1983 suggested is flanked by a
smaller tubercle; the material available does not permit confirmation of
this. The bone here is marked by radiating striae that likely are an
attachment point for the *M. depressor mandibulae*.

The ventral ramus of the supratemporal is formed by two laminae,
laterally and medially, that wrap around and flank the dorsal and medial
borders of the quadrate. Dorsally, the quadrate is covered by the short,
lateral lamina in a deep ventral groove between this and the medial
ramus that was largely filled by the cartilage capping the dorsal edge
of the quadrate. A small notch on the lateral edge of the ventral ramus
exposed the dorsal edge of the quadrate. The medial lamina is the larger
of the two laminae and descends for almost half of the dorsoventral
height of the quadrate, along its pterygoid lamella, and envelops its
anterior edge and the dorsal edge of the pterygoid. NHMUK PV R2133 shows
a split for passage of a blood vessel to the quadrate ventrally
[@Kirton1983]. At its ventral extent the ventral ramus of the
supratemporal intervenes between the pterygoid and stapes, overlapping
the dorsal edge of the former and developing a small facet for the
latter. Tubercles on the anterior face may mark the origin of the
*M. adductor mandibulae externus* [@Kirton1983].

Reconstruction of the occipital region of *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* has
varied between those of @Andrews1910 [fig. 4], @Appleby1956 [fig. 21],
and @Kirton1983 [fig. 6]. In particular, the amount of interosseous
cartilage present between elements. The heavily pitted articular
surfaces of basisphenoid, basioccipital, and those elements that contact
these suggest that cartilage was present between these elements (see
[\[OicenicusBasioccipital,OicenicusParabasisphenoid,OicenicusExoccipital,OicenicusOpisthotic,OicenicusProotic,OicenicusStapes\]](#OicenicusBasioccipital,OicenicusParabasisphenoid,OicenicusExoccipital,OicenicusOpisthotic,OicenicusProotic,OicenicusStapes){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusBasioccipital,OicenicusParabasisphenoid,OicenicusExoccipital,OicenicusOpisthotic,OicenicusProotic,OicenicusStapes"}).
In more complete specimens (e.g.  GLAHM V1901, V1921; NHMUK PV R2133,
2161), it is possible to re-articulate the posterior cranial elements.
The elements surrounding the otic capsule do not fit closely by virtue
of the need to encompass the osseous labyrinth, and the angular
displacement between the supraoccipital, exoccipital, and opisthotic
that permits this. Further, the articulation between the parietal and
supratemporal laterally broadens the occipital region in
*Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* beyond that reconstructed by @Andrews1910
[fig. 4 @Appleby1956 fig. 21]. This separates the supratemporal and
quadrate further, which increases the lateral space around the
opisthotic and stapes
([\[fig:Oicenicus-occipital\]](#fig:Oicenicus-occipital){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-occipital"}). The variability in the
ossification of posterior skull elements
(e.g. [\[OicenicusQuadrate,OicenicusParabasisphenoid,OicenicusBasioccipital\]](#OicenicusQuadrate,OicenicusParabasisphenoid,OicenicusBasioccipital){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusQuadrate,OicenicusParabasisphenoid,OicenicusBasioccipital"})
suggests that these elements may have formed closer contact later in
ontogeny. It is possible that this delayed ossification in
*Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* is retained as a paedomorphic character. No
specimens show direct contact between these elements.

## Squamosal ##

The triangular squamosal has been a problematic element due to its
delicacy and its superficial placement on the dorsolateral portion of
the skull
([\[fig:Oicenicus-skull-latdor,pl04\]](#fig:Oicenicus-skull-latdor,pl04){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-skull-latdor,pl04"}, figs 1, 2). The squamosal
is occasionally not preserved in ichthyosaur specimens, but has since
been demonstrated to be present in most taxa
[@Maisch2001; @McGowan2003]. Moreover, descriptions are few and
incomplete [e.g. @Andrews1910 p. 18]. The squamosal is oriented with a
horizontal dorsal margin and the longest edge situated anteroventrally,
and has a noticeable externally convex curvature that fits around the
underlying cheek bones. The anterodorsal portion is strongly grooved
where it is overlapped anteriorly by the postfrontal. Ventrally, the
curved facet for the overlapping postorbital is developed; this bone
covers about half of the anteroventral surface of the lateral squamosal.
This area is roughened for this contact and features low ridges and
grooves. At the ventral corner, there is a strongly developed facet for
the quadratojugal, which overlaps about one-third of the dorsoventral
height of the squamosal. This is marked by a curved ridge surrounding
the facet and a vertical ridge within the area of contact that
corresponds to a groove on the quadratojugal. A narrow posteroventral
tongue descends and intervenes between the postorbital and
quadratojugal, extending along the posterior edge of the former.
Medially, the squamosal contacts the supratemporal dorsally and
postorbital ventrally and is smoothed for this contact. The dorsal
margin is slightly thickened and complexly shaped to fit into the dorsal
groove on the underlying supratemporal. At the posterodorsal corner, a
posteromedially-directed, triangular facet, which extends along the
dorsal quarter of the posterior margin, articulates with the quadrate.
The external surface of the squamosal is confluent with this facet, but
internally, its surface is deflected medially to accommodate the
quadrate facet. The posterior margin ventral to the facet is raised into
a ridge that becomes more pronounced ventrally.

## Postorbital ##

The postorbital is a narrow, crescentic element that forms much of the
posterior margin of the orbit and the external surface of the cheek
([\[fig:Oicenicus-skull-latdor,pl04\]](#fig:Oicenicus-skull-latdor,pl04){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-skull-latdor,pl04"}, figs 3, 4). The
anterodorsal portion is developed into a wide transverse flange that
continues the supraorbital crest from the postfrontal anteriorly.
Anteriorly, the distal tip forms a tongue-and-groove contact between the
postorbital and postfrontal. This flange is smoothed externally on the
rim of the orbit, narrowing posteroventrally, until the orbital rim is
continued by the main body of the bone. Posterior to this flange is a
broad, medially positioned lamella that extends the dorsal half of the
postorbital and gives it a squared outline. This lamella is slightly
roughened on its lateral surface extending onto a small portion of the
supraorbital crest, and has a slightly irregular margin. The squamosal
twists medially and posteriorly to overlap most of the posterodorsal
lamella. Dorsally the postorbital contacts the supratemporal. Ventrally,
the postorbital is flatter, although still convex laterally. The
anterior margin has a strong, but obtusely angled curvature ventrally to
the reduction of the supraorbital crest that corresponds to a heel on
the posterior margin. This heel is very irregular, with low ridges on
the external surface. Andrews' [-@Andrews1910 fig. 9 C] description of
this element is brief and he neither describes nor figures this notable
change in orientation of the postorbital, nor the heel formed. The
ventral portion of the postorbital tapers slightly distally, but ends in
an irregular ventral margin overlying the jugal.

Medially, the postorbital is largely flattened and slightly roughened on
the posterodorsal lamella where it contacts the lateral face of the
anterior ramus of the supratemporal. The anterior surface of the
supraorbital rim is concave, with the rim itself located medially. The
posterior margin of the posterodorsal lamella develops a low ridge,
directed anteroventrally, that crosses much of the ventral portion of
the postorbital. This marks the anterior extent of the contact with the
underlying quadratojugal. The contact has low ridges and grooves that
extend to the heel of the postorbital and form the marginal
irregularities described above. Anteroventrally, the ridge heightens and
a ventral groove accepts the jugal ventral to the roof formed by the
concave postorbital. Where this is broken (e.g.  NHMUK PV R3893), the
curved facet can be seen that corresponds to the curved dorsal process
of the jugal. The medial surface of the postorbital is also roughened
and low-ridged, and has an irregular ventral margin as the jugal is not
completely overlapped.

## Quadratojugal ##

The small and thin quadratojugal is a triangular element that forms the
posteroventral corner of the lateral skull and cheek region, but is not
well-exposed in either view, as it is the most medial element in this
region
([\[fig:Oicenicus-skull-lat,fig:Oicenicus-quadratojugal\]](#fig:Oicenicus-skull-lat,fig:Oicenicus-quadratojugal){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-skull-lat,fig:Oicenicus-quadratojugal"}).
@Kirton1983 noted that the quadratojugal figured by @Andrews1910
[fig. 10] was more triangular than those she figured [@Kirton1983
fig. 4]. Kirton interpreted this as a proportional elongation of the
quadratojugal through ontogeny (compare NHMUK PV R2180, R4522 and
R4753). Larger specimens of quadratojugals in *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*
are more dorsoventrally elongate than in smaller specimens. Kirton's
explanation is likely as there would have been extensive growth and
remodelling around the quadrate and articular region during ontogeny,
which would have affected the growth of the cheek. Much of the anterior
lateral surface is roughened where this contacts the medial surfaces of
the overlying postorbital dorsally and jugal ventrally. The posterior
and ventral margins of the quadratojugal are ridged and mark the
boundary of these contacts. The descending tongue of the squamosal runs
along most of the posterior part of the lateral surface in a prominent
groove, which then ends in a roughened facet for the heel of the
postorbital. On the ventral margin, the ridge is slightly undercut
dorsally where the dorsal process of the jugal slots into it. The medial
surface of the quadratojugal is mostly smooth anteriorly. Its posterior
margin is distinctly ridged and, at half of the height of the
quadratojugal, the bone projects medially to form a small cup-like facet
that is flush with the posteroventral margin and oriented slightly
medially. This is where the quadrate articulates, and just dorsal to the
facet there is a small triangular depression that @Kirton1983
interpreted as the attachment point for the ligaments that bind these
two bones.

## Jugal ##

The jugal has an overall bowed [J]{.sans-serif}-shape formed by a long
suborbital bar and a posteriorly ascending process
([\[fig:Oicenicus-skull-lat,fig:Oicenicus-palate,pl04\]](#fig:Oicenicus-skull-lat,fig:Oicenicus-palate,pl04){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-skull-lat,fig:Oicenicus-palate,pl04"}, figs 5,
6). Anteriorly, the jugal bar overlaps the lateral face of the maxilla,
lateral to the external wall of the alveolar groove, with low ridges to
accommodate this contact. The anteriormost portion is splayed wide over
the maxilla and bounded dorsally by the posteroventral process of the
lachrymal, which accommodates the dorsal surface of the jugal in its
ventral groove (see
[\[OicenicusLachrymal\]](#OicenicusLachrymal){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusLachrymal"}). In this region, the jugal is flattened
laterally, but widens posteriorly to a sub-circular cross section by the
midpoint of the orbit. The ventral portion has a longitudinal groove
that tapers posteriorly, erroneously labelled "facet for maxilla" by
@Andrews1910 [fig. 10], giving the area posterior to this the appearance
of a strut that is directed and broadens posteroventrally, meeting the
ventral margin of the postorbital just anterior to the heel. The jugal
bar is bowed both laterally and ventrally to create space for the jaw
muscles that pass medially through the subtemporal fenestra, and to
house the sclerotic ring. The posterior part of the jugal ascends
dorsally as a flattened process that forms the posterior part of the
orbit and part of the cheek region. This process is enclosed on its
anterolateral surface by the postorbital, the contact for which is
marked by dorsoventrally-oriented ridges on the external surface of the
jugal. The dorsal tip of this process is rounded. Posteroventrally, the
jugal spreads slightly to form a ventral heel that is often roughened,
and was interpreted by @Kirton1983 as the attachment site of a ligament.
This is most likely point of attachment for the jugomandibular ligament
that extends from the posteroventral jugal heel to the lateral part of
the articular region of the mandible [@Herrel1998; @Evans2008].

The medial surface of the jugal bar is more flattened than the lateral
surface. The anterior portion is ridged longitudinally, matching the
contact on the maxilla. The dorsal surface also has undulating ridges in
some specimens (e.g.  GLAHM V1921). Medially, the surface of the dorsal
process contacts the quadratojugal, showing a slight ridge around the
area of contact along the dorsal portion. Running dorsoventrally along
the contact, the jugal has a low ridge that slots into a small groove on
the lateral surface of the quadratojugal. The posterior margins of the
jugal and quadratojugal here form a continuous straight line along the
posterior of the cheek. The dorsal process gently narrows dorsally, with
the anterior and posterior borders forming low undulations, especially
where they are covered laterally and medially.

## Orbital fenestra ##

The orbit and sclerotic ring of *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* is,
relatively and absolutely, one of the largest in nature
([\[fig:Oicenicus-skull-lat\]](#fig:Oicenicus-skull-lat){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-skull-lat"}). @McGowan1976 [676] defined the
orbital ratio as the ratio of orbital diameter to jaw length. For NHMUK
PV R3013 this is approximately 280 mm/1000 mm = 0.28
([\[tbl:Oicenicus-skull-measurements\]](#tbl:Oicenicus-skull-measurements){reference-type="ref"
reference="tbl:Oicenicus-skull-measurements"}). Indeed, a large orbit is
found often in Ichthyosauria, particularly Mixosauridae and
Thunnosauria. Unlike the supratemporal fenestra, the configuration of
the bones that make up the orbit remain consistent in ichthyosaurs. In
*Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*, the prefrontal, postfrontal, and jugal --
forming the dorsal and ventral margins of the orbit -- are angled
obliquely anteriorly to the anteroposterior axis of the skull so that
the orbit faces slightly anteriorly
([\[fig:Oicenicus-skull-dor\]](#fig:Oicenicus-skull-dor){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-skull-dor"}). The sclerotic ring aligns with
this, implying that the eyes were directed slightly anteriorly also,
increasing the binocular visual region.

## Sclerotic Plates ##

Despite their delicacy, several sclerotic plates of *Ophthalmosaurus
icenicus* have been preserved
([\[fig:Oicenicus-skull-lat\]](#fig:Oicenicus-skull-lat){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-skull-lat"}). Complete, articulated sclerotic
rings are rare, however, NHMUK PV R4753 (complete) and GLAHM V1921
(partially complete) possess 15 plates, although Andrews' [-@Andrews1910
fig. 23] reconstruction shows only 14. Andrews also notes (p. 31) the
increased ossification of the sclerotic plates through ontogeny. The
sclerotic plates are bipartite, separated into orbital and corneal
portions. The orbital part is squared, with a crenate orbital margin,
and curved to surround the eye within. The corneal portion is flattened
and angled at \~130° internally to the orbital portion, tapering to
about one-half the width of the orbital part at its corneal margin. This
inclination of the sclerotic plates causes a marked doming of the
articulated sclerotic ring; about one-half as high as its diameter. The
corneal margin of the sclerotic plates may be rounded where it meets the
plates on either side. This margin is also straight and does not have
the inclination seen in many other reptiles, allowing @Kirton1983 to
infer that *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* did not possess a scleral sulcus.
The articulation between the sclerotic plates is formed by interlocking
laminae developed on the margins. This is seen as a complex
interdigitation in cross section, although at the surface, the suture
appears straight, becoming wavy towards the corneal edge. Striae on the
surface of the sclerotic plates are mostly parallel to the radial
margins. On the internal and external surfaces, at the junction between
the orbital and corneal portions, the surfaces have irregular
tuberosities from which striae radiate. Interpreted as the attachment
point of the muscles important in accommodation [Cramptori's and
Brückes' muscles: @Kirton1983], the ratio of apertural to external
sclerotic ring diameter of NHMUK PV R4753 is estimated at 0.4.

## Vomer ##

The narrow and elongate vomers suffer from poor preservation and
description, like the palatines
([\[OicenicusPalatine,fig:Oicenicus-skull-dor,fig:Oicenicus-vomer,pl05\]](#OicenicusPalatine,fig:Oicenicus-skull-dor,fig:Oicenicus-vomer,pl05){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusPalatine,fig:Oicenicus-skull-dor,fig:Oicenicus-vomer,pl05"},
Figs 1--4). @Andrews1910 tentatively figured and described a vomer
(NHMUK PV R3533) as left, whereas @Kirton1983 [p. 43] interpreted this
as the right vomer; the latter view is followed here. As discussed above
(see
[\[OicenicusPremaxilla\]](#OicenicusPremaxilla){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusPremaxilla"}), the anteriormost portion is enclosed
within the medial canal of the premaxilla, held ventral to the nasals,
and posterior to this, the vomers form the anteromedial portion of the
palate. The delicacy of the bone means that no single specimen is known
in its entirety, but two examples ( NHMUK PV R4753 and GLAHM V1129)
allow a largely complete restoration to be made
([\[fig:Oicenicus-vomer\]](#fig:Oicenicus-vomer){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-vomer"}). Overall, the vomers feature a narrow
and flattened basal plate from which rises a dorsal sheet that is higher
posteriorly. The anterior extensions of the vomer taper anteriorly and
make up about one-half of the total length of the vomer. They are angled
dorsolaterally, to accept the ventromedial border of the premaxilla
ventrolaterally in a slightly concave facet that continues for much of
the length of the vomer. Posteriorly, the basal plate broadens and the
premaxillary facet becomes less pronounced and is deflected laterally.
Although smooth anteriorly, the surface of this facet becomes rugose
posteriorly. Medially, along the anterior process, the left and right
vomers contact in a simple, roughened butt joint that begins slightly
anterior to the premaxillary facet. This contact between the vomers
excludes the pterygoids from palatal view for about two-thirds of the
length of the vomer, although the pterygoids continue anteriorly for a
short distance dorsal to the vomers.

In the posterior portion of the vomer, the dorsal sheet rises in the
sagittal plane. Anteriorly, this sheet rises gently from the anterior
extension and, dorsally, develops a slight medial flange and laterally
positioned concavity. The ventral border of this concavity is formed by
a dorsally concave ridge that extends posteriorly to the dorsalmost
extent of the dorsal sheet. At this point, the vomer is drawn out into
three prominent projections that are directed anterodorsally. No
specimen shows these projections in their entirety; in NHMUK PV R4753
these are 5 mm wide, with buttress-like bases on the vomer. The extent
of the projections is unknown, but likely supported the structures of
the nasal capsule, like similar projections found on the maxilla and
nasal (see ). The ridge separates the anterodorsal concavity from a more
posterior concavity on the lateral face of the dorsal sheet. Posterior
to these concavities, the dorsal sheet falls sharply towards the
horizontal posterior extension of the vomer. The ventral margin of the
vomer in this region forms the anterior border of the internal naris,
where the bone is thickened and rounded. By analogy with modern
reptiles, @Kirton1983 [p. 44] interpreted this region as the internal
nasal chamber. The anterodorsal concavity forms the floor and medial
wall of the *vestibulum nasi* with the ventral ridge dividing this from
the postvestibular region. Posteriorly lies the choanal tube (part of
the *cavum nasi proprium*, the posterior concavity) that forms a direct
connection between the *vestibulum nasi* and the choana.

The medial surface of the dorsal sheet features an anteriorly narrowing
facet that contacted the anterior process of the pterygoid. Ventral to
this, the vomer is expanded medially to enclose the pterygoids and this
contact is strengthened by a posterior groove. The posterior process of
the vomer fits between the palatine laterally and pterygoid medially.
Here, the vomer has a narrow overlap onto these bones, but this
increases and becomes more rugose anteriorly towards the vertical
expansion of the vomer. The posterior extension is flattened and
horizontal, narrowing posteriorly.

## Palatine ##

The thin palatine bones form the posterolateral portion of the palate
([\[fig:Oicenicus-palate,fig:Oicenicus-palatine,pl05\]](#fig:Oicenicus-palate,fig:Oicenicus-palatine,pl05){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-palate,fig:Oicenicus-palatine,pl05"}, figs 5,
6). Like the vomers (see
[\[OicenicusVomer\]](#OicenicusVomer){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusVomer"}), their delicate nature has caused
uncertainty in previous identifications. @Andrews1910 [p. 29, fig. 18;
NHMUK PV R4693--5] and @Appleby1956 [p. 423, figs 10 & 11, PETMG R220]
described what they considered right palatines. @Kirton1983 [p. 38,
fig. 10], based on the study of additional specimens, interpreted
Andrews' specimen as a left palatine and Appleby's as a left vomer,
figured in dorsal view. These latter interpretations are followed here.

The palatine comprises a quadrangular posterior plate that divides
anteriorly into a narrow lateral process and broader medial process.
Between these, the palatine forms the posterior margin of the internal
naris. The elongate lateral process is triangular in cross section and
tapers distally. On its dorsal surface, it is overlapped by the maxilla
laterally, with a longitudinal ridge that marks the extent of contact.
This overlap continues posteriorly along the lateral margin of the
palatine and is marked by a small, but complex, tongue-and-groove
structure that holds the dorsomedial margin of the maxilla. The dorsal
surface of the broader medial tongue bears an ascending projection at
the posterior end of the internal naris. @Kirton1983 suggested this
might have supported the wall tissues of the nasopharyngeal duct.
@Andrews1910 showed this process smaller than it is in NHMUK PV R4753
due to breakage. Posteriorly, the palatine is poorly known, but its
extent can be deduced from comparisons with specimens NHMUK PV R4753,
R4693--5 and GLAHM V1129, and other taxa, for example, *Ichthyosaurus*
[@McGowan1973]. The posterior contact with the pterygoid is a transverse
interdigitating suture. At its posterolateral portion, the palatine
forms a small part of the margin of the subtemporal fenestra.

Ventrally, the palatine overlaps the vomer along its medial border. The
border of this contact is marked on the palatine by a small shelf that
develops from the point of division of the anterior processes to hold
the ventrolateral margin of the vomer. Dorsal to this, the medial edge
of the palatine extends dorsomedially as the medial anterior projection
[@Kirton1983], and lies flat against the lateral surface of the vertical
expansion of the vomer. The contact surface is rugose and finely ridged
ventromedially. Both the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the palatine
have branching grooves showing the passage of surrounding vessels.
Foramina pierce the palatine and can be seen on the dorsal surface of
NHMUK PV R4753 around the border of the internal naris. Further grooves
show the paths of blood vessels. @Kirton1983 proposed that these
structures marked the paths of the palatine nerve and blood vessels that
supplied the nasal tissues, possibly including the nasal artery.

## Epipterygoid ##

No example of this bone has been recognised amongst the material
referred to *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*. It is ossified in the genus
*Ichthyosaurus* [@McGowan1973], but it is not certain whether its
absence in *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* indicates its failure to ossify or
loss during collection. The complete lack of known epipterygoids for
*Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* suggest that it did not ossify. While facets
for articulation with the epipterygoid are present on the parietal
dorsally and the pterygoid ventrally, these are reduced compared to
*Ichthyosaurus* [@McGowan1973], for example, supporting the lack of
ossification of the epipterygoid. Ossification of the epipterygoid is
apparently variable: it was not present in an otherwise complete skull
of *Platypterygius australis* described by @Kear2005a [599], however,
large examples are known from specimens referred to *'Platypterygius'*
(V. Fischer, pers. comm., 2015). This indicates that ossification during
ontogeny may occur, although this doesn't seem to be the case in
*Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*.

## Pterygoid ##

The pterygoids are the largest elements in the palate, comprising most
of the posterior portion
([\[fig:Oicenicus-skull-dor,pl06\]](#fig:Oicenicus-skull-dor,pl06){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-skull-dor,pl06"}, figs 1, 2). Each pterygoid is
composed of a sheet-like, anterior palatal ramus and a more complex,
posterior quadrate ramus; the latter of these is more robust and so this
portion is often better preserved.

The anterior ramus consists of a rod of bone (visible dorsally) that
extends from the quadrate ramus of the pterygoid anteriorly, anterior to
the level of the internal naris. The anterior portion of the anterior
ramus is narrow and dorsally raised to fit between the two vomers, which
exclude it from palatal view. In their anterior portions (approximately
one-half the length of the pterygoid), the rami from the two pterygoids
curve medially and meet ventrally just posterior to the internal naris
([\[fig:Oicenicus-palate\]](#fig:Oicenicus-palate){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-palate"}), forming the anterior apex of the
interpterygoid vacuity. Posterior to the internal naris, the pterygoid
expands laterally into a horizontal shelf, which is constricted
posteriorly. The pterygoids are raised into medially concave dorsal
flanges that accept and hold the anterior parasphenoidal rostrum
(cultriform process, see
[\[OicenicusParabasisphenoid\]](#OicenicusParabasisphenoid){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusParabasisphenoid"}) between them. Laterally, the
walls of this flange fit into the facet on the medial wall of the vomer
(see [\[OicenicusVomer\]](#OicenicusVomer){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusVomer"}), and the vomer itself lies upon a small
ventrolateral shelf of the pterygoid. Posterior to this region, the
dorsal flange becomes shallower, and the medial border of the pterygoid
is thicker and rounded, marking the lateral border of the interpterygoid
vacuity. Lateral to the main rod of the anterior ramus, the pterygoid is
expanded laterally into a broad sheet that accepts the palatine
anteriorly in an interdigitating transverse suture, and anteromedially
overlaps the posterior process of the vomer on its medial edge. The
lateral border of the pterygoid bears fine striations for this union. A
low ridge extends anterolaterally along the dorsal side of the lateral
sheet, meeting the medial margin of a small lateral flange ( GLAHM
V1921: [\[pl06\]](#pl06){reference-type="ref" reference="pl06"}, figs 1,
2) that overlaps the palatine. Ventrally, the lateral sheet of the
pterygoid is concave posteriorly, interpreted by @Kirton1983 as the
origination point for the *M. adductor mandibulae internus
pterygoideus*. Posterior to this concavity, the sheet narrows and is
variably angled laterally (compare GLAHM V1921 with NHMUK PV R2180 and
R3893).

The quadrate ramus is separated from the palatal ramus by a constriction
formed by emarginations for the subtemporal fenestra laterally and the
interpterygoid vacuity medially. Posteriorly, it is drawn out laterally,
medially, and dorsally into three wing-like flanges that hold the
basisphenoid and quadrate. Laterally, the dorsal and lateral processes
together form a continuous, slightly concave surface for contact with
the medial face of the pterygoid lamella of the quadrate. The ventral
flange of the supratemporal overlaps the medial surface of the dorsal
wing of the pterygoid (as noted by [@Andrews1910 28]; [@Kirton1983 40]).
The medial wing extends ventral to the lateral bar of the stapes and
forms a shelf, dorsally holding the basisphenoid; the anterior portion
of the medial wing forms a socket to accommodate the basipterygoid
processes. Ventral to the stapes, the pterygoid forms a floor to the
cranioquadrate passage and possibly the inner ear cavity [@Kirton1983].
The posterior edge of the medial and lateral wings bear irregular
striations and pitting that extends ventrally and may mark the location
of muscle insertion for the hypaxial series. This inference comes from
the lack of enlarged basal tubers on the basioccipital in
*Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* onto which the muscles are attached in other
reptile groups.

## Quadrate ##

The large and robust quadrate consists of two lamellae: the medial
pterygoid lamella, facing posteromedially, and the lateral occipital
lamella, facing posterolaterally; the latter is visible in occipital
view and bears the articular condyle ventrally
([\[fig:Oicenicus-skull-lat,fig:Oicenicus-palate,fig:Oicenicus-quadrate,tbl:Oicenicus-skull-measurements,pl06\]](#fig:Oicenicus-skull-lat,fig:Oicenicus-palate,fig:Oicenicus-quadrate,tbl:Oicenicus-skull-measurements,pl06){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-skull-lat,fig:Oicenicus-palate,fig:Oicenicus-quadrate,tbl:Oicenicus-skull-measurements,pl06"},
figs 3--5). In occipital view, the quadrate has a broad
[C]{.sans-serif}-shape -- convexly curved medially and emarginated
laterally to form the posteromedial border of the quadrate foramen. The
dorsal portion of the external face of the occipital lamella is smooth,
slightly convex laterally, and, in some specmiens, a small facet is
developed dorsally (e.g.  GLAHM V1920), associated with a change in
surface texture, which indicates overlap by the lateral lamina of the
supratemporal. Ventral to this, the external surface is raised is some
specimens along the dorsal margin of the quadrate foramen dorsolaterally
from the stapedial facet (e.g.  LEICT 100'1949/197). The ventral portion
of the occipital face is markedly concave dorsoventrally, broadening
towards the margin of the articular condyle on the ventral surface of
the quadrate. A small rugose area marks the facet for the quadratojugal,
just dorsal to the condyle, along the emarginated lateral margin. The
quadratojugal also contacts the emargination dorsally, forming the
lateral border to the quadrate foramen. Externally, the pterygoid
lamella is largely planar. The border with the occipital lamella is
marked by a ridge that becomes less well defined ventrally. Medial to
this border, and at, or ventral to, one-half of the height of the
quadrate, is the elliptical stapedial facet. This facet varies in its
excavation and position between specimens; it appears as a shallow
rugose depression. When the facet is more deeply excavated, it is
surrounded by a raised and sharp ridge, particularly defined
posteriorly, with a prominent tuberosity ventral to the facet, seen in
well ossified individuals (as in GLAHM V1878). The tuberosity may be
extended into a ridge, and features minute foramina leading @Kirton1983
to interpret this tuberosity as the attachment point for the ligament
that bound the quadrate and pterygoid. On the floor of the stapedial
facet, there is an irregular growth that @Kirton1983 [p. 37] suggested
to be the point of connection for the intercalary cartilage, between the
stapes and quadrate. The dorsal one-third of the pterygoid lamella is
roughened and was overlapped by the ventral ramus of the supratemporal,
which wrapped around onto the occipital lamella. The ventral two-thirds
of the quadrate, excepting the stapedial facet, were closely applied to
the quadrate flange of the pterygoid.

Laterally, the margin of the lateral emargination of the quadrate is
rounded and smooth, made up of finished bone. The dorsal and medial
edges of the quadrate are roughened and grooved for the application of
the cartilage that surrounded this bone. Dorsally, the margin of the
quadrate slots into a ventral groove on the lateral ramus of the
supratemporal (see
[\[OicenicusSupratemporal\]](#OicenicusSupratemporal){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusSupratemporal"}). The anterior cartilage may have
met the epipterygoid, or extended to this region, even if it remained
unossified, as suggested by @Kirton1983 [36--37] in *Ophthalmosaurus
icenicus* and @McGowan1973 [23--25] in *Ichthyosaurus* (see
[\[OicenicusEpipterygoid\]](#OicenicusEpipterygoid){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusEpipterygoid"}). @Andrews1910 [p. 19] noted that
NHMUK PV R2133 has a well-developed angular protrusion on the
ventromedial portion of the quadrate margin. The internal (anterior)
face of the quadrate is concave and forms much of the smooth posterior
wall of the adductor chamber. The central portion of this face likely
provided attachment for the *M. adductor mandibulae posterior*, which
may have originated from a depression in this area. A second, more
dorsal depression may be seen (as in GLAHM V1899) from which the
*M. adductor mandibulae externus* complex may have originated
[@Kirton1983]. The ventral surface of the quadrate forming the robust
and broad articular condyle is irregularly pitted for the application of
the articular cartilage. This face is convex both dorsoventrally and
laterally, allowing smooth motion of the jaw articulation. The condyle
is formed of two bosses, positioned more anterior and posterior and
facing anterolaterally and posterolaterally respectively, separated by a
groove, approximately transversely oriented. Medially, the condyle is
horizontal, but laterally is dorsally deflected, and the groove between
the bosses curves anteriorly. The more anterior boss is smaller than the
posterior, and articulates with the anterolateral portion of the glenoid
fossa on the surangular. The more posterior boss articulates with the
concave anterior face of the articular.

The quadrate is highly variable between specimens and individuals of
*Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*. This may reflect the degree of ossification
exhibited, an effect of the cartilage that surrounds many of the
occipital elements, potentially caused by functional-usage or
ontogenetic variation. Clear differences can be seen in the ossification
of the dorsal and medial margins and the shape of the occipital portion
of the lateral emargination. This can cause the outline of the quadrate
to vary between wide and rounded to narrower and squared (compare GLAHM
V1878 and NHMUK PV R2133), as noted by @Andrews1910 and @Appleby1956.
The development of the stapedial facet, its position and surrounding
features also varies: NHMUK PV R2133 shows the stapedial facet in the
ventral portion of the bone and with a low ridge outline (possibly
reduced by poor preservation), whereas in GLAHM V1920 it is slightly
more dorsally positioned.

## Parabasisphenoid ##

The parabasisphenoid (parasphenoid-basisphenoid) is a complex bone
formed by the fusion of the parasphenoid to the ventral surface of the
basisphenoid, and therefore these are considered together in the present
study
([\[fig:Oicenicus-palate,fig:Oicenicus-basisphenoid,pl07\]](#fig:Oicenicus-palate,fig:Oicenicus-basisphenoid,pl07){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-palate,fig:Oicenicus-basisphenoid,pl07"}). The
parasphenoid rostrum (cultriform process of the parasphenoid) is
frequently broken and poorly known in *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*. This
forms the base of the braincase, extending forwards to be held between
the anterior rami of the pterygoids (see
[\[OicenicusPterygoid\]](#OicenicusPterygoid){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusPterygoid"}). Here the parabasisphenoid is pinched
in ventrally and so has a diamond cross section in anterior and
posterior views, narrowing anteriorly. Posterior to the parasphenoidal
pterygoid facets, the dorsal surface of the cultriform process becomes
concave and roughened, and was overlain by the fused trabecular
cartilages. For much of the length of this process the bone is deep and
narrow, with a medial ventral ridge, but becomes wider and more
elliptical posteriorly. The parasphenoid rostrum becomes thinner
dorsoventrally as it meets the basisphenoid. Although often difficult to
discern, the parasphenoid widens and extends around anterior and lateral
margins of the internal carotid foramen (see below) on the ventral
surface of the basisphenoid. The parasphenoid also forms a small shelf
on the anterior margin of the elliptical external carotid (see NHMUK PV
R2180 and GLAHM V1886).

The posterior portion of the parabasisphenoid (basisphenoid) forms a
large, complexly shaped ossification anterior to the basioccipital, with
lateral wings anteriorly to hold the palatal ramus of the pterygoid. The
trapezoidal anterior face of the basisphenoid is mostly smooth
periosteal bone and extends laterally from the main body by the
basipterygoid processes. This surface extends posteriorly as a concavity
on the lateral surface of the basisphenoid and lines an extracranial
space, an anterior part of the cranioquadrate passage [@Goodrich1930].
@Kirton1983 proposed that the muscle slips from the extrinsic eye muscle
group might insert here, as in extant crocodilians [@Underwood1970],
although there is no evidence of scarring. A small pit, lateral to the
pituitary fossa (see below) may mark the attachment point of an eye
muscle. Some specimens preserve small nutritive foramina piercing the
anterior surface of the basisphenoid. Medially, the *dorsum sellae*
rises vertically, posterior to the pituitary fossa, interrupting the
smooth anterior surface. The *dorsum sellae* is developed dorsally into
two processes separated by a notch that continues posteriorly on the
posterodorsal surface. @Kirton1983 interpreted these processes as
ossifications at the base of the *pilae antoticae*. Ventral to the
*dorsum sellae*, the paired internal carotid arteries passed through an
undivided foramen that is angled posteroventrally, entering the
basisphenoid on its ventral surface and narrowing along their course.
The hollow on the anterior surface of the basisphenoid between the
internal carotid foramen and the *dorsum sellae* is the pituitary fossa
marking the area where the pituitary body would have been located.
Ventral to the pituitary fossa, lateral to the midline are a pair of
slightly raised ovoid depressions that mark the posterior limit of the
trabecular cartilages [@Kirton1983], termed the lower cylindrical
processes by Siebenrock ([-@Siebenrock1893], translated in
[@Siebenrock1894]; [@Andrews1910]).

Laterally, the basisphenoid is drawn into the short and robust
basipterygoid processes, each with a rugose distal surface and low
marginal ridge indicating that this would have been covered in life by
cartilage. These processes fit into corresponding sockets between the
palatal and quadrate rami of the pterygoids, and the inferred thickness
of cartilage led @Kirton1983 to suggest that some movement was possible
between the palate and braincase. However, the elongate anterior facets
of the pterygoid with the vomer and palatine, and the interlocking
contacts on these bones, suggest that movement of the pterygoid would
have been minimal. The basipterygoid processes have a groove on their
posteroventral edges marking the passage of a nerves or blood vessels,
possibly the palatine ramus of the facial (VII) nerve [@Kirton1983
p. 22]. The lateral surface posterior to the basipterygoid processes is
heavily pitted and angled dorsolaterally and slightly posteriorly
forming the stapedial facet, which contacts the ventral part of the
medial surface of the stapes. This surrounding cartilage may have led to
variation in the ossification of the basipterygoid processes: NHMUK PV
R2164 shows well defined, squared processes, whereas in NHMUK PV R2161
they are more spread and rounded in ventral view [@Andrews1910 fig. 6].
The ventral surface of the basisphenoid is finished in periosteal bone
and is rounded posteriorly. This surface is pierced centrally by the
single unpaired internal carotid foramen. The entirety of the posterior
surface is deeply pitted for contact with the basioccipital. This is
split into two portions, a vertical region ventrally and a
posterodorsally angled region dorsally, separated by a horizontal ridge.
Vertical ridges separate the basioccipital facet from the lateral
stapedial facets. A median groove runs dorsoventrally across the whole
of the posterior surface, meeting the dorsal notch between the two
processes of the *dorsum sellae*. This groove may indicate that the
basisphenoid originally ossified from two lateral centres
[@Andrews1910; @Kirton1983], and some examples show cracks or are broken
along this line. @Andrews1910 and @McGowan1973 concluded that the dorsal
notch marked the point of an upturned vestige of the notochord.

## Prootic ##

The small, subrectangular prootics are surrounded by the cartilage of
the otic capsule, lacking direct bony contact with the rest of the
braincase
([\[fig:Oicenicus-prootic,fig:Oicenicus-occipital,pl08\]](#fig:Oicenicus-prootic,fig:Oicenicus-occipital,pl08){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-prootic,fig:Oicenicus-occipital,pl08"}, figs 1,
2). This, and the disassociated nature of the material, makes their
orientation and placement problematic. @Kirton1983 resolved this problem
by comparing the prootic of *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* with an
acid-prepared Liassic skull (NEWHM G.44.19) indicating that the figured
prootic ([1.7](#fig:Oicenicus-prootic){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-prootic"}, NHMUK PV R4522) must be a right
prootic. This bone takes the shape of a widened D in posterior view: the
lateral edge is straight whilst the medial edge is gently curved. Along
with the semicircular canals on the internal face (see below), this
feature can aid in orienting the bone. This orientation agrees with
@McGowan1973, but disagrees with @Appleby1956 [p. 412, fig. 4] who had
reversed the two canals and sidedness of the bone.

The external (anterior) face is roughened and irregularly pierced by
nutritive foramina for the origin of muscle slips. Kirton
([-@Kirton1983], [after @Haas1973] suggested that either part of the
*M. adductor mandibulae externus* or the *M. protractor pterygoidei*
attached there as in living reptiles. Ventrally and medially, a ridge is
developed for this attachment towards, and parallel to, the margins of
the prootic. The edges of the prootic were continuous with the cartilage
of the otic capsule and so are irregularly pitted. The thickness of the
prootic represents cross sections of the walls of the otic capsule, and
these are thickest at the ventralmost corner of the bone. The internal
(posterior) face of the prootic, like the opisthotic and supraoccipital
(see ), shows the impressions of the membranous labyrinth. These each
take the form of a [V]{.sans-serif}-shaped, smooth-floored excavation.
The position of the prootic in the anterolateral region of the otic
capsule means that the limbs of the impression should accommodate the
anterior vertical and the horizontal semicircular canals respectively
[@Baird1970; @Kirton1983]. Kirton's [-@Kirton1983 pp 27--28] comparison
with modern reptiles led her to conclude that the wider medial channel
must have accommodated the horizontal canal, whereas the narrower
lateral impression housed the anterior vertical canal. This was based
upon the assumption that the horizontal canal passed externally from its
source to a terminal ampulla [@Hamilton1964; @Baird1970], whereas in
Appleby's [-@Appleby1956] interpretation, the horizontal canal would
pass internally; Kirton's view is followed here [@Evans2008]. The
horizontal canal swells ventrally and this space is occupied by the
terminal ampulla for the anterior vertical canal ["anterior ampulla" of
@Baird1970 fig. 7]. Medial to the depression for the anterior ampulla,
where the two arms of the [V]{.sans-serif} converge, the impression is
widened further, possibly representing the position of the sacculus.
@Appleby1956 indicated this was divided into two parts: the ventral part
is a continuation of the horizontal canal impression that @Kirton1983
interpreted as part of the utriculus and may be offset slightly
([@Andrews1910 fig. 3 A], NHMUK PV R2162).

## Opisthotic ##

The opisthotics consist of a massive occipital portion, which takes part
in the walls of the otic capsule, and a slender paroccipital process
that reaches dorsolaterally towards, and articulates with, the skull
roof
([\[fig:Oicenicus-opisthotic,fig:Oicenicus-occipital,pl08\]](#fig:Oicenicus-opisthotic,fig:Oicenicus-occipital,pl08){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-opisthotic,fig:Oicenicus-occipital,pl08"}, figs
3--8). @Appleby1956 [p. 414] disagreed with Andrews' [-@Andrews1910
p. 9] orientation of the opisthotic; Appleby's interpretation is
followed here. The anterior face is concave and the surface is
roughened, with small nutrient foramina, for the attachment of muscle
slips, possibly of the *M. adductor mandibulae externus* group
[@Kirton1983]. A ridge extends dorsolaterally across this face and along
the paroccipital process. This surface extends dorsally, where it is
also roughened and pierced by foramina, indicating further muscle
attachment. Ventrally, the opisthotic is roughened for the application
of cartilage, and divided into two facets for articulation with the
basioccipital anteromedially, and the stapes laterally. The
basioccipital facet is smaller and consists of a dorsal deflection of
the posteromedial corner of the ventral surface of the opisthotic. A
larger area of the ventral surface comprises a facet for the stapes,
which is divided into two parts by a groove that runs mediolaterally.
The anteromedial face of the opisthotic faces the otic capsule. This
face shows a wide [V]{.sans-serif}-shaped impression formed by two
smooth-floored channels that join anteroventrally, impressions of the
posterior components of the membranous labyrinth of the inner ear. The
posterior channel likely housed the posterior vertical semicircular
canal [@Baird1970; @Kirton1983]. The anterior channel curves slightly
towards the horizontal and is interpreted as the impression for the
horizontal semicircular canal [@Baird1970; @Kirton1983]. A large
concavity in which the posterior ampulla was likely held is developed
where the two channels join [@Baird1970; @Kirton1983], and the posterior
channel widens towards this junction. The bone that surrounds the
labyrinth impression is pitted irregularly for the cartilaginous
component of the otic capsule. The impressions of the labyrinth are
continued by similar impressions seen on the anterolateral face of the
supraoccipital and the posterior face of the prootic (see
[\[OicenicusProotic,OicenicusSupraoccipital\]](#OicenicusProotic,OicenicusSupraoccipital){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusProotic,OicenicusSupraoccipital"}). Slightly
anterior to the ventral ampulla impression, the groove on the ventral
surface notches the ventral margin. The medial articulating surface is
narrower posteriorly and also notched by the vagus foramen on the
posterior face ["jugular foramen" of @Andrews1910], which may curve
forward around the anteromedial face (see NHMUK PV R2133).

The posterior face of the opisthotic dorsally shows a continuation of
the pitting for muscle attachment from the dorsal surface. Ventral to
this, the lateral wall of the channel of the vagus foramen continues
horizontally. This is held medially between the dorsal portion of the
opisthotic dorsally, which continues as a ridge from the paroccipital
process, and the dorsal margin of the basioccipital facet ventrally,
which is here raised. The opisthotic possibly contacts the exoccipital
around this foramen, but an articular facet can only be seen in
well-ossified specimens ( NHMUK PV R2161 and LEICT 100'1949/64;
[@Appleby1956]) indicating that the contact was not close, except in
these specimens [@Kirton1983]. The dorsal exoccipital facet, when
ossified, is developed on a bony projection from the dorsomedial corner
of the bone, whereas the ventral facet is developed only rarely
[@Appleby1956; @Kirton1983]. The opisthotic is drawn out dorsolaterally
into the paroccipital process, narrowing slightly distally. @Kirton1983
described this as slender, however, it can appear variably developed
depending on the length of the paroccipital process; the holotype of
*Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* (NHMUK PV R2133) has rather a thick, short
paroccipital process that is slightly compressed dorsolaterally.
Dorsally, this process forms the floor of the posttemporal fossa, and
ventrally contributed to the roof of the cranioquadrate passage. At its
distal end, the paroccipital process is flattened and roughened for the
application of cartilage where it meets the ventral ramus of the
supratemporal (see
[\[OicenicusSupratemporal\]](#OicenicusSupratemporal){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusSupratemporal"}). The tip is often poorly ossified,
and it ends in a blunt ellipse with little evidence for a developed
facet on the supratemporal. In well-ossified individuals (e.g. the
holotype of *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*, NHMUK PV R2133, and LEICT
100'1949/64) the distal end forms a two-part supratemporal facet,
although still some cartilage would have intervened. @Kirton1983 further
suggested the possibility of some movement between these elements, but
the two-part opisthotic facet on the supratemporal would likely have
mitigated this.

## Supraoccipital ##

The supraoccipital forms an arch around the dorsal part of the *foramen
magnum* and takes part laterally in the otic capsule
([\[fig:Oicenicus-skull-dor,fig:Oicenicus-occipital,pl09\]](#fig:Oicenicus-skull-dor,fig:Oicenicus-occipital,pl09){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-skull-dor,fig:Oicenicus-occipital,pl09"}, figs
1--5). This arch sits atop the exoccipitals (see
[\[OicenicusExoccipital\]](#OicenicusExoccipital){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusExoccipital"}), and underlaps the parietals medially
(see [\[OicenicusParietal\]](#OicenicusParietal){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusParietal"}). Anteriorly, the dorsal portion of the
surface of the supraoccipital is smooth with two anterior-directed
ridges that form an anteriorly-open [C]{.sans-serif}-shape in dorsal and
ventral views. Ventrally, the anterior surface is slightly roughened.
Two laterally-directed foramina pierce the lateral walls on the medial
surface; intraosseous canals pass through to the posterior face. The
dorsal margin of the supraoccipital has a shallow, transverse groove
that is roughened, indicating the presence of the cartilaginous portion
of the supraoccipital dorsally, ventral to the parietal. This margin and
groove are variably developed depending on the level of ossification of
the individuals. The dorsal groove widens laterally and anteriorly
towards the edges of the supraoccipital and is separated from the
internal face by a sharp ridge. The ventral exoccipital facets show the
effect of the strong anterior extension of the supratemporal in their
apex-anterior, triangular shape. These facets are concave to accept the
dorsal surface of the exoccipitals, which fits closely with only a thin
layer of connective tissue intervening [@Kirton1983]. On the
anterolateral face of the supraoccipital, further impressions of the
structures from the otic capsule can be seen, which face
ventrolaterally. These impressions are [T]{.sans-serif}-shaped, the stem
directed anteroventrally. @Kirton1983 interpreted these as impressions
of the posterior vertical (dorsal) and anterior vertical (ventral)
semicircular canals at their point of origin from the common crus.

The posterior face of the supratemporal is roughened dorsally where it
is overlapped by the parietal, smoother ventrally, and is slightly
convex following the dorsoventral curvature. Dorsally, it may be squared
or more rounded, like a semicircular arch (compare NHMUK PV R2162 and
LEICT 100'1949/43). Lateral to the *foramen magnum*, the surface is
pierced by foramina (from the internal surface) that lie in shallow
depressions and face posterolaterally. Lateral to these foramina, the
bone is notched immediately dorsal to the capsular region. Dorsal to the
*foramen magnum*, the internal arch of the supraoccipital is variable.
This may be a simple arch, but frequently a blunt median process
projects from the dorsal surface of the *foramen magnum*. The ventral
opening of the arch on the supraoccipital is constricted by the medial
expansion of the bone in most specimens ("lateral processes" of
[@Andrews1910]; [@Appleby1956]). Where present, the surfaces of these
projections are roughened for the attachment of cartilage or ligaments
that may have separated the supratemporal arch from the *foramen magnum*
ventrally [@Andrews1910; @Kirton1983]. @Andrews1910 suggested that the
spinal cord occupied only the ventral portion (i.e. between the
exoccipitals) rather than the entire, considerable, vertical extent of
the *foramen magnum* [@Kirton1983]. The dorsal (supraoccipital) portion
of the *foramen magnum* may have carried other structures, including
perhaps the paired cerebral veins, as suggested by @Kirton1983, in the
two concavities either side of the median process in the roof of the
*foramen magnum*. Alternatively, the lateral foramina may have allowed
passage of the lateral branches of the *vena capitis dorsalis* into the
cranial cavity [@Kirton1983]. In some reptile groups, these enter the
braincase anterior to the supraoccipital, but may have moved
posteriorly, becoming "trapped" [@Kirton1983 p. 31] in the lateral edge
of the supraoccipital in *Ophthalmosaurus* and *Ichthyosaurus*.
Furthermore, @McGowan1973, following @Andrews1910, suggested that the
foramina carried extensions of the endolymphatic sac, as in extant
lizards, for example, Iguanidae and Gekkonidae. Although the purpose of
the endolymphatic sac is uncertain [@Kluge1967; @Kluge1987; @Bauer1989],
it seems to play an important role in adult calcium metabolism or
skeletal ossification [@Mangione2001; @Daza2008].

## Exoccipital ##

The two exoccipitals form the sides of the *foramen magnum* as short
columns between the supraoccipital dorsally and the basioccipital
ventrally
([\[fig:Oicenicus-exoccipital,fig:Oicenicus-occipital,tbl:Oicenicus-skull-measurements,pl09\]](#fig:Oicenicus-exoccipital,fig:Oicenicus-occipital,tbl:Oicenicus-skull-measurements,pl09){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-exoccipital,fig:Oicenicus-occipital,tbl:Oicenicus-skull-measurements,pl09"},
figs 6--11). Dorsally, the contact surface is smooth and slopes
ventrally and anterolaterally, following the ventral surface on the
supraoccipital. Lateral to the supraoccipital facet, each exoccipital
has a small contact with the opisthotic. This facet is divided into two
parts, and the dorsal part forms a small lip over the contribution of
the exoccipital to the vagus foramen. The ventral contact with the
opisthotic occurs along the ventral edges of the exoccipital
["posteroventral protuberance" of @Appleby1956]. As mentioned above (see
[\[OicenicusOpisthotic\]](#OicenicusOpisthotic){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusOpisthotic"}) the contact is close only in
well-ossified individuals, otherwise cartilage intervened. The ventral
surface of the exoccipital is roughened where cartilage was applied for
contact with the basioccipital. This facet is elliptical and convex to
fit into the exoccipital facets on the basioccipital, although this
contact was not as close as the contact between exoccipital and
supraoccipital. Anteriorly, the exoccipital is drawn out into
tongue-like projections making it more triangular ventrally and
extending the contact with the basioccipital [@Andrews1910]. Dorsal to
this, the dorsal surface protrudes slightly anteriorly to form a groove
that extends around the bone laterally as the vagus foramen. Medially,
the exoccipital is pierced by two foramina anteriorly (the posterior is
larger), on this tongue, interpreted by Kirton ([-@Kirton1983], [after
@Andrews1910]) as exits for branches of the hypoglossal (XII) nerve.
These pass through the exoccipital before emerging on its lateral and
posterior faces. The anterior lateral exit is the smaller foramen and
opens into the vagus foramen. @Maisch1997a described a pair of
exoccipitals (SMNS 10170), one of which had three foramina (five between
the two exoccipitals) that may have carried the fourth branch of the XII
nerve. Specimen GPIT 1795/2 shows a splitting of the anterior foramina.
When joined, this would carry two branches (first and second) of the XII
nerve. A ridge on the posterior face, extending obliquely down from the
dorsomedial edge, is roughened, possibly for the attachment of the
occipital muscles [@Kirton1983].

The massive basioccipital comprises the lowest portion of the occiput
and forms the whole, large sub-hemispherical boss of the occipital
condyle
([\[fig:Oicenicus-skull-latdor,fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof-palate,fig:Oicenicus-basioccipital,fig:Oicenicus-occipital,pl10\]](#fig:Oicenicus-skull-latdor,fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof-palate,fig:Oicenicus-basioccipital,fig:Oicenicus-occipital,pl10){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-skull-latdor,fig:Oicenicus-ventralskullroof-palate,fig:Oicenicus-basioccipital,fig:Oicenicus-occipital,pl10"}).
The anterior and lateral faces are flattened and heavily pitted for a
relatively thick covering of cartilage [@Kirton1983]. The ventral
one-half of the anterior face is developed into two oval bosses,
separated by a central vertical groove, that mark the contact with the
basisphenoid. These bosses form a notch in the ventral surface of the
basioccipial that is particularly evident in specimens where the groove
is well developed (e.g.  NHMUK PV R4522;
[1.10](#fig:Oicenicus-basioccipital){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-basioccipital"}). A diamond-shaped area that
bears a small central pit is developed dorsal to the basisphenoid facet.
This area may be drawn out into an anterior process (shown in GLAHM
V1070) that @Kirton1983 proposed as the homologue of the basioccipital
peg more clearly seen in *Ichthyosaurus* [@McGowan1973]. @Kirton1983
further proposed that this structure was a vestige of the notochord
extending into the *cavum cranii*. This feature is highly variable
between taxa and its presence is homoplastic across ichthyosaur
phylogeny [@Motani1999c; @Maisch2000c]. As the diamond-shaped area in
*Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* matches the relative position to the
notochordal pit in *Ichthyosaurus*, it is likely that this does
represent a vestige of the basioccipital peg. The development of the
basioccipital peg may represent the extent of ossification of braincase
elements in different taxa. Dorsally, the basioccipital features two
lateral facets for the exoccipitals. These are concave, rounded
depressions with a heavily rugose surface into which the ventral face of
the exoccipital fits, likely with much cartilage intervening. The
exoccipital facets are almost continuous with the anterior and lateral
faces of the basioccipital, but the posterior and medial margins are
raised into a high wall. Between the two exoccipital facets is a medial
sagittal ridge with a central, longitudinal channel, surfaced with
finished bone. This marks the ventral surface of the *foramen magnum*,
which is surrounded laterally by the two exoccipitals and the
supraoccipital dorsally. Variation is seen in the surface of this
channel: the holotype of *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* (NHMUK PV R2133) has
an hourglass-shaped area of smooth bone, while in NHMUK PV 47430 there
is only a small triangular section of smooth bone posteriorly,
surrounded by roughened bone. The posterior articular surface of the
parasphenoid faces posterodorsally, while the anterior face of the
basioccipital is flat. Therefore in articulation, the basioccipital is
angled with the anterior surface facing anteroventrally and the
basioccipital condyle directed posterodorsally
([\[fig:Oicenicus-occlat\]](#fig:Oicenicus-occlat){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-occlat"}).

The lateral faces of the basioccipital are divided into two facets that
mark the contact with the stapes ventrally and opisthotic dorsally. Like
the anterior face, this region is rugose for cartilage attachment. The
opisthotic facet is smaller than the stapedial facet and divided into
two parts: a posterodorsal, deeply pitted, triangular portion, and
ventral and anterior to this, a circular raised area of smooth bone.
Based on her reconstruction of the occipital region, @Kirton1983 posited
that the cartilage between the opisthotic and basioccipital thinned
anteroventrally, suggesting a thinning of the walls of the otic capsule.
This is coupled with a small depression just anterior to the contact
surface with the opisthotic, interpreted as part of the cochlear recess.
The ventral portion of the lateral face is continuous with the
basisphenoid facet on the anterior face of the basioccipital and
contacts the basioccipital facet on the medial head of the stapes.

The articular condyle occupies much of the central portion of the
posterior face of the basioccipital. This surface is irregular for
application of the articular cartilage, but not as rugose as the
anterior face. The convex condyle is centrally placed and has a
near-central notochordal pit that is elongated dorsoventrally and
variably developed. @Appleby1956 [p. 407] further described
discontinuous concentric striations that surround the notochordal pit in
well-preserved specimens. @Andrews1910 [p. 6] noted that the dorsal part
of the condyle might be pinched, as in the holotype specimen (NHMUK PV
R2133). The wide extracondylar area, which extends from the sides of the
basioccipital ventrally as an elongate, concave strip is developed
around the condyle
([\[tbl:Oicenicus-basioccipital-measurements\]](#tbl:Oicenicus-basioccipital-measurements){reference-type="ref"
reference="tbl:Oicenicus-basioccipital-measurements"}). This includes
two convex areas of smooth periosteal bone that are separated from the
condyle by posteromedial ridges. The smooth areas of the extracondylar
area are variable in extent, and may reach a point dorsal to the
notochordal pit on the condyle in some specmiens, but not so far
dorsally in others, with great variation between these extremes
[@Appleby1956]. Although not always clear, these areas are separated
ventrally by a narrow, roughened area around the ventral notch that may
be raised dorsal to the flanking smooth surfaces.

## Stapes ##

Articulating between the braincase and the quadrate, the stapes is
integral to the posterior skull, despite being a hyoid derivative
([@Romer1956];
[\[fig:Oicenicus-stapes,fig:Oicenicus-occipital,tbl:Oicenicus-skull-measurements,pl11\]](#fig:Oicenicus-stapes,fig:Oicenicus-occipital,tbl:Oicenicus-skull-measurements,pl11){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-stapes,fig:Oicenicus-occipital,tbl:Oicenicus-skull-measurements,pl11"}).
The stapes has a massive medial head that contacts the basioccipital and
basisphenoid and a more slender shaft that extends ventrolaterally to
contact the quadrate. Medially, the head of the stapes abuts against
broad surfaces on the sides of the basioccipital and basisphenoid (see
[\[OicenicusParabasisphenoid,OicenicusBasioccipital\]](#OicenicusParabasisphenoid,OicenicusBasioccipital){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusParabasisphenoid,OicenicusBasioccipital"}) rather
than fitting into a *fenestra ovalis* [@Romer1956; @Kirton1983]. This
head of the stapes is broad, convex and rugose for the application of
cartilage. @Kirton1983 noted that only a small area of the stapes
contacted the periotic (perilymphatic) cistern, which is unlike the more
extensive contacts that are seen in many modern reptiles [@Baird1970].
@Appleby1961 reported an anterodorsally directed groove on the posterior
side of the head. Dorsally, the stapes articulates with the ventral side
of the opisthotic in a bipartite facet, each portion separated by an
anteromedially directed groove that corresponds to a similar groove in
the stapedial facet of the opisthotic (see
[\[OicenicusOpisthotic\]](#OicenicusOpisthotic){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusOpisthotic"}). When in articulation, this groove
forms a channel, probably accommodating nerves. The opisthotic facet on
the stapes is roughened and cartilage may have intervened in the
contact, leading to variable development of this facet. Clear separation
can be seen in the articulated braincase of specimen PETMG R220
([\[fig:Oicenicus-occipital\]](#fig:Oicenicus-occipital){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-occipital"}). The restoration of this specimen
is however imperfect, for example, the right stapes does not contact the
quadrate laterally (see below and
[\[OicenicusQuadrate\]](#OicenicusQuadrate){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusQuadrate"}).

Lateral to the opisthotic facet, the dorsal surface of the stapes is
smooth and continuous anteriorly with the lateral surface of the
basisphenoid. This surface falls from the high medial head as the stapes
narrows laterally into its shaft. In this portion, the stapes forms part
of the posteroventral floor of the cranioquadrate passage dorsally. The
stapes contacts the pterygoid in two facets, medially and laterally. The
medial contact is ventral on the medial head, which rests on the dorsal
surface of the medial flange of the pterygoid (see
[\[OicenicusPterygoid\]](#OicenicusPterygoid){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusPterygoid"}), although there is no clear facet on
the stapes. Laterally, the stapes contacts the posterior edge of the
quadrate flange of the pterygoid where the pterygoid is overlapped by
the supratemporal. This facet is more clearly seen as a rugosity on the
anterior surface of the distal stapedial shaft that extends for most of
the length of the shaft. @Kirton1983 described NHMUK PV R2133 as showing
an articulated stapes, quadrate, supratemporal (her squamosal) and
pterygoid in articulation. While these elements are no longer
articulated, it can still be seen that the stapes had extensive contact
with the supratemporal along the anteriormost surface of the stapedial
shaft. Dorsal to the rugosity of the pterygoid-supratemporal facet is a
ridge that twists ventrally along the shaft as it nears the medial head
of the stapes. The ventral margin of the stapedial shaft is notably
excavated lateral to the medial head of the stapes, between the two
pterygoid facets, creating a space between these two bones; there is no
stapedial facet. The distal face of the shaft is a pinched elliptical
facet that contacts the medial face of the quadrate. Cartilage would
have been applied to the pitted surface and the level of individual
ossification would cause the variable development in the stapedial facet
on the quadrate (see
[\[OicenicusQuadrate\]](#OicenicusQuadrate){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusQuadrate"}).

The relationship of the stapes to its surrounding tissues has caused
some of the many features described above. The channel between the
opisthotic-stapes contact was assigned to the glossopharyngeal (IX)
nerve by @Andrews1910, @Appleby1956 [@Appleby1961] and @Kirton1983.
Their proposed route for the glossopharyngeal (IX) nerve in
*Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* is unusual among reptiles. In most living
reptiles, the nerve exits through the vagus foramen (see
[\[OicenicusOpisthotic,OicenicusExoccipital\]](#OicenicusOpisthotic,OicenicusExoccipital){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusOpisthotic,OicenicusExoccipital"}), although some
taxa have an additional foramen through which this nerve exits the skull
(e.g. some turtles: [@Bellairs1981]). Reconstruction of the otic capsule
([\[fig:Oicenicus-occipital\]](#fig:Oicenicus-occipital){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-occipital"}) suggests that the channel emerges
from the most ventral region of the otic capsule, near the cochlear
recess of the osseous labyrinth [@Kirton1983]. Kirton alternatively
proposed that it could carry the hyomandibular branch of the facial
(VII) nerve. The facial (VII) nerve originates from the anterior edge of
the otic capsule, normally passing posterodorsally over the head of the
stapes, medial to the dorsal process [@Hopson1979; @Stark1979]. In this
interpretation, the anterior half of the opisthotic facet on the stapes
may be equivalent to the dorsal process. @McGowan1973 suggested a
similar channel in *Ichthyosaurus* may have accommodated the stapedial
artery. However, @Kirton1983 thought this unlikely as a similar route is
absent in other reptiles: the stapedial artery passes extracranially
along the lateral wall of the braincase, dorsal to the stapedial shaft
and alongside the *vena capitis lateralis* [@Bellairs1981]. The
glossopharyngeal (IX) nerve typically passes medial to the stapedial
artery, ventral to the otic capsule, supporting its passage between the
opisthotic and stapes. The space created between the stapes and
pterygoid may have allowed passage of the stapedial artery. A notch that
may mark the upwards passage of this artery dorsal to the
basipterygoidal processes is present on the anterior portion of the
medial head of the stapes [@Kirton1983]. Appleby's [-@Appleby1961]
reconstruction does not show a space between the stapes and pterygoid.
He thus concluded that the stapedial artery passed through the groove on
the posterior side of the stapedial head. This groove may instead mark
the continued path of the structures that passed through the channel in
the opisthotic-stapes contact; the absence of a continuation for this
groove and its ultimate origin makes its true nature uncertain.

## Dentary ##

The dentary forms much of the anterior and lateral portions of the
mandible, extending for much of its length, and holds the entirety of
the lower tooth row
([\[fig:Oicenicus-skull-lat,fig:Oicenicus-jaw,tbl:Oicenicus-skull-measurements\]](#fig:Oicenicus-skull-lat,fig:Oicenicus-jaw,tbl:Oicenicus-skull-measurements){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-skull-lat,fig:Oicenicus-jaw,tbl:Oicenicus-skull-measurements"}).
Its form corresponds to that of the premaxilla in many respects. The
anterior extremity tapers towards the anterior of the mandible and
medially the two dentaries meet in the anterior part of the mandibular
symphysis, which is continued posteriorly by the splenials
[@Andrews1910]. Externally, the dentary is convex, and wide dorsally to
accommodate the tooth row. Towards the dorsal part of the external face,
a longitudinal groove with associated foramina passes into an
intraosseous passage, akin to that seen in the premaxillae, and extends
for approximately two-thirds of the dentary. Anteriorly, this groove
becomes discontinuous and the pitting for the foramina that pierce the
groove is clearer. From the anterior tip, the dentary deepens
posteriorly, reaching its maximum depth at about one-half of its length.
The medial face of each dentary is grooved and when articulated they
form the anterior portion of the channel which holds the Meckelian
cartilage. Like the premaxillae, the anteriormost tips of the dentaries
are separated and this space would likely have been filled by connective
tissue. Posterior to their anterior separation, the dentary is largely
in contact with the splenial medially and the internal face is
longitudinally grooved and roughened. It is often difficult to see the
anterior extent of contact with the anterior fork of the splenial, but
this contact may be marked by changes in the surface texture of the
dentary towards the dorsal and ventral margins of the medial surface. At
the posterior of the mandibular symphysis, there is a low ridge towards
the ventral of the medial face of the dentary that runs ventrally and
around its ventral margin. This marks the extent of contact with the
angular, which intervenes between the dentary and splenial and briefly
runs along the ventral margin of the dentary.

Dorsally, the dentary forms the alveolar groove between the raised
lateral and medial walls. The anteriormost portion, along part of the
symphysis has no medial wall and the teeth are small. Strong depressions
on the lateral wall of the alveolar groove indicate close placement of
the teeth here. Posteriorly, the groove widens to accommodate larger
teeth and the medial wall is raised dorsal to the lateral wall so that
the curved teeth (see
[\[OicenicusDentition\]](#OicenicusDentition){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusDentition"}) are angled dorsolaterally like in the
premaxilla. The groove extends and is dentigerous for about two-thirds
of the length of the mandible, almost the entire length of the dentary.
Towards the posterior of the dentary, the alveolar groove narrows, and
the posteriormost tooth is positioned slightly posterior to the external
naris. The groove here shallows, narrows, and is pinched out posterior
to the posteriormost tooth by the lateral and medial walls. Posteriorly,
the dentary tapers dorsoventrally and mediolaterally, becoming more
superficial on the lateral face of the mandible. Here, the dentary is
excluded from medial view by the surangular and splenial.

label="fig:Oicenicus-jawlat"}
[\[fig:Oicenicus-jawmed\]]{#fig:Oicenicus-jawmed
label="fig:Oicenicus-jawmed"}

## Splenial ##

The splenial covers much of the internal (medial) surface of the lower
jaw
([\[fig:Oicenicus-jaw,pl12\]](#fig:Oicenicus-jaw,pl12){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-jaw,pl12"}, figs 1, 2). Its anterior region is
forked, with the rami applied to the dorsal and ventral margins of the
dentary, and allowing the confluence of the Meckelian canals between the
two dentaries. The rami of the fork are also rugose on their exposed
medial faces marking their participation in the mandibular symphysis
[@Andrews1910], which extends posterior to the main body of the
splenial. The opening for the Meckelian canal may be the foramen
described by @Gilmore1905 [@Gilmore1906]. For much of its length the
splenial takes the form of a thin, vertical sheet of bone. Dorsally
placed on the internal (lateral) face, a ridge with a wide, longitudinal
groove ventrally is developed where the splenial forms the medial and
dorsal walls to the Meckelian canal. The ridge becomes lower and less
distinct posteriorly, gradually moving towards the gently undulating
dorsal margin of the bone as the prearticular intervenes. @Andrews1910
thought that the surangular formed a portion of the internal wall of the
alveolar groove; this is in addition to the dentary so that the
surangular does not have any indentation from the tooth placement. A
small part of the splenial is in contact with the surangular, but
posteriorly, this is usurped by the prearticular. The ventral margin is
more simple as the sheet of the splenial simply curves around the
angular, a sliver of which can be seen in lateral view. Posteriorly, the
splenial narrows dorsoventrally into a point lying against the angular,
with its ventral margin fitting into a small groove. Dorsally on this
taper, there is a small anteroventrally-aligned notch directed towards a
small foramen, possibly for passage of the *chorda tympani* branch of
the VII nerve [@Kirton1983].

## Surangular ##

The large surangular forms much of the posterior part of the mandible,
between the angular, prearticular and articular (see
[\[OicenicusAngular,OicenicusPrearticular,OicenicusArticular\]](#OicenicusAngular,OicenicusPrearticular,OicenicusArticular){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusAngular,OicenicusPrearticular,OicenicusArticular"}),
as well as sharing the jaw articulation with the articular (e.g.  NHMUK
PV R2180, [\[pl14\]](#pl14){reference-type="ref" reference="pl14"}, figs
1, 2, 5, 6) and forming a major attachment for muscle groups
([\[fig:Oicenicus-jaw,pl12\]](#fig:Oicenicus-jaw,pl12){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-jaw,pl12"}, figs 3, 4). Much of its anterior
section is a vertical sheet, placed medial (internal) to the dentary,
which forms the lateral wall of the Meckelian canal. This is marked by a
ridge dorsal to a channel in the medial surface of the surangular that
is placed dorsally at its anterior, but becomes more centrally placed as
the surangular dorsoventrally widens posteriorly. Both the dorsal and
ventral margins are rounded, especially posteriorly, as the dentary and
angular respectively surround the surangular. The anterior extremity of
the surangular is unknown. Another groove (the *fossa surangularis*)
runs along the lateral face of the surangular ventral to the dentary and
is pitted by foramina that pass through the bone and into the Meckelian
canal, allowing passage of nerves and blood vessels. These nerves and
vessels emerge medially through an elongate, ventrally placed foramen.
Posteriorly, this groove becomes discontinuous and is reduced to several
pits of the foramina.

The surangular is held between the dentary (laterally) and the splenial
(medially) for much of its length; although some evidence of the extent
of contact can be seen, there are no well-developed facets. Posterior to
the termination of the alveolar groove, the surangular becomes more
robust. The dorsal margin is drawn up dorsally into a low, rounded
paracoronoid process, to which the *M. adductor mandibulae internus
pseudotemporalis* division was attached [@Kirton1983]. Posterior to the
paracoronoid process, the dorsal margin of the surangular is raised into
a sharper, dorsomedially directed preglenoid process. Striations cover
this process on its medial surface and over a rounded ridge situated
posteroventrally, likely indicating attachment area of the *M. adductor
mandibulae externus* group (hence is termed the "M.A.M.E. process" by
[@Fischer2012 14]; [@Kirton1983]). @Andrews1910 considered these two
processes together to be the functional equivalent of the coronoid
process, the coronoid being non-ossified or lost (see
[\[OicenicusCoronoid\]](#OicenicusCoronoid){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusCoronoid"}). The dorsal margin is excavated
posterior to these processes, marking the location of the jaw glenoid.
Posterior to the paracoronoid and preglenoid processes, the dorsal
margin of the surangular is deflected laterally and the medial face
excavated slightly to form the glenoid fossa. The surface of this area
is roughened for the application of the articular cartilage that would
have rotated against the anterior boss of the quadrate condyle; the
cartilage extended posteromedially onto the articular. Here, there may
be a tubercle developed [@Andrews1910]. As the angular broadens
dorsoventrally towards its posterior end, it covers much of the lateral
face of the surangular. The surangular is roughened for this contact,
and a low ridge may mark the dorsal line of contact. At its
posteriormost part, the surangular is roughened and the posterior margin
is crenate where the cartilage of the retroarticular process would have
covered it and the angular (see
[\[OicenicusAngular\]](#OicenicusAngular){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusAngular"}).

## Angular ##

The angular is an elongate bone that forms the ventral margin of much of
the mandible and the floor of the Meckelian canal
([\[fig:Oicenicus-skull-lat,fig:Oicenicus-jaw,pl13\]](#fig:Oicenicus-skull-lat,fig:Oicenicus-jaw,pl13){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-skull-lat,fig:Oicenicus-jaw,pl13"}, figs 1, 2,
[\[pl14\]](#pl14){reference-type="ref" reference="pl14"}). Anteriorly,
it is thin and narrow and excluded from view by the dentary and
splenial, which envelop the bone and meet ventrally. Along most of the
lower jaw, the angular is visible ventrally, and a narrow portion can be
seen mediolaterally. Ventrally, the margin is rounded and widens
posteriorly, whereas the dorsal margin is moulded into two deep grooves.
The more laterally placed groove holds the ventral margin of the
surangular and the medial groove forms the floor of the Meckelian canal,
which would be filled in life by the Meckelian cartilage. These two
grooves are bounded by high walls that ascend medially and laterally on
the angular, becoming higher towards the posterior end of the bone. A
third groove is placed ventrally on the medial face and holds the
ventral margin of the splenial; all three grooves continue along most of
the angular. The posterior of the angular curves slightly dorsally and
the lateral side ascends to cover much of the surangular (see
[\[OicenicusSurangular\]](#OicenicusSurangular){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusSurangular"}). Along its posterior margin, the
angular is finely crenate, like the surangular, where it was covered by
cartilage of the retroarticular process. Internally, the angular meets
the articular, the latter of which has two distinct facets for this
contact, and borders the prearticular also (see
[\[OicenicusPrearticular\]](#OicenicusPrearticular){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusPrearticular"}; [@Andrews1910]).

## Coronoid ##

The coronoid in *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* is lost entirely. Because of
this, the muscle attachments of the coronoid process have shifted in
*Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* to the paracoronoid process of the surangular
(see
[\[OicenicusSurangular\]](#OicenicusSurangular){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusSurangular"}). @Andrews1910 [p. 34, fig. 20]
identified the prearticular as the coronoid, however, its true identity
was not recognised until later [e.g. @Romer1956 212; @Kirton1983].
@Martill1987 also indicated the presence of a right coronoid in BUCCM
1983/1008, but again this likely represents the prearticular. It seems
that this element is notably reduced or absent in all ichthyosaur taxa
and so makes identification and comparison of this element problematic.
The position of the coronoid in the medial lower jaw also makes it
likely that any disturbance that would expose this bone may conspire to
remove it entirely.

## Prearticular ##

The prearticular in *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* was identified as the
coronoid by @Andrews1910 [see
[\[OicenicusCoronoid\]](#OicenicusCoronoid){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusCoronoid"}], but this was corrected by @Romer1956
[p. 212] and @Kirton1983
([\[fig:Oicenicus-jaw,pl13\]](#fig:Oicenicus-jaw,pl13){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-jaw,pl13"}, figs 3, 4). It is an elongate, thin
bone, which, coupled with its position in the middle of the mandible,
means that it is infrequently preserved and identified. The prearticular
forms a very thin medial wall of the Meckelian canal along much of its
length, tapering both dorsoventrally and laterally at its anterior end.
Its relationship with the angular is unclear, but it may insert into the
more medial groove alongside the Meckel's cartilage, or run along the
medial dorsal edge. Arching of the dorsal margin allows the prearticular
to contact the surangular for some distance dorsal to the Meckelian
canal. The prearticular is obscured from medial view by the splenial.
Posteriorly, the prearticular rises towards a peak that lies just
ventral to the paracoronoid process of the surangular in articulation
(see NHMUK PV R2180); this equates to the coronoid process, although it
does not function as such [@Andrews1910]. Posterior to this region, the
prearticular narrows dorsoventrally to form a bar that lies just against
the internal face of the medial flange of the angular, forming part of
the medial wall of the adductor fossa that separates the prearticular
from the surangular. The medial face is rugose and this spreads
ventrally onto the angular, possibly marking the insertion of a medial
portion of the *M. adductor mandibulae internus pterygoideus* division
[@Haas1973; @Kirton1983]; similar relations are seen in extant lizards
and *Sphenodon*. At its most posterior part, the prearticular covers the
ventral edge of the articular.

## Articular ##

This compact and posteriorly rounded bone is found at the posterior of
the mandible and forms the posterior surface of the jaw articulation
with the quadrate condyle
([\[fig:Oicenicus-jaw,pl14\]](#fig:Oicenicus-jaw,pl14){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-jaw,pl14"}). It is held by the surangular
laterally and the angular and prearticular ventrally so that the ovoid
anterior surface is angled slightly dorsally and medially
([\[fig:Oicenicus-jawmed\]](#fig:Oicenicus-jawmed){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-jawmed"}). This surface meets the articular
facet of the quadrate and is slightly concave and pitted for the
articular cartilage that would spread between it and the glenoid on the
surangular just anterior to the articular. The long axis of this ovoid
face aligns with the long axis of the posterior boss of the quadrate, to
which it articulates. Ventrally, the articular would have been continued
anteriorly by the mandibular cartilage and is pitted for its
application. The lateral face is flattened where it meets the surangular
laterally, and has a horizontal groove in its middle section that
follows the contours of the underlying bone. @Andrews1910 noted that two
facets are present ventrally for contact with the medial face of the
angular. The medial face is slightly roughened and is saddle shaped;
convex dorsoventrally and anteroposteriorly concave. Ventrally this face
is roughened for overlap by the prearticular whereas the dorsal margin
is much thinner and closely applied to the surangular laterally. The
posterior of the articular is round and roughened and continued in
cartilage that extended into a short and rounded retroarticular process
[@Kirton1983].

## Dentition ##

The dentition of *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* has long been problematic:
the size of the teeth and their poor attachment has meant that few
specimens have been recovered with teeth in position, or even with teeth
present at all ([1.12](#fig:Oicenicus-teeth){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-teeth"}). Early descriptions noted the small
size of the teeth and that they might have been restricted to the
anterior of the rostrum despite there being well-developed alveolar
grooves along the whole of each jaw ramus (see
[\[OicenicusPremaxilla,OicenicusMaxilla,OicenicusDentary\]](#OicenicusPremaxilla,OicenicusMaxilla,OicenicusDentary){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusPremaxilla,OicenicusMaxilla,OicenicusDentary"};
[@Lydekker1889; @Andrews1907; @Andrews1910]). @Gasparini1988 described
*'Ophthalmosaurus monocharactus'* with several teeth present in the
maxilla (figs 2a & 3a), however, this taxon is not consistent with
*Ophthalmosaurus* [@Maisch2000c 89]. @Kirton1983 considered
*Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* to have approximately 40 teeth in each jaw
ramus based on tooth counts on NHMUK PV R3893 and from the impressions
in NHMUK PV R4753 and GLAHM V1129. My own (BCM) examination of these
specimens shows these to be minimum estimates: in each, teeth may be
missing or impressions indistinct, but all can be confidently referred
to *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* based upon associated diagnostic material.
NHMUK PV R3893 has at least 27 premaxillary teeth or impressions in each
ramus, with the anteriormost tip of the premaxilla missing; it is
unlikely that the true count would have been much higher. In GLAHM
V1921, the tooth impressions are more distinct along the whole of the
maxilla and dentary; this specimen had 23 teeth in the maxilla and
probably 48 (more than 44) dentary teeth. The maxilla in NHMUK PV R3893
is incomplete posteriorly, but held at least 12 teeth in its anterior
portion. This brings the total number of teeth in each jaw ramus to
around 50.

In *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*, the teeth are small, especially compared
to other ichthyosaurs, with the largest held towards the middle of each
alveolar groove. Tooth size rapidly decreases approaching each end of
the groove as it narrows; this is clearest anteriorly where the small
teeth were held in defined sockets (see
[\[OicenicusPremaxilla,OicenicusDentary\]](#OicenicusPremaxilla,OicenicusDentary){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusPremaxilla,OicenicusDentary"}). @Kirton1983
estimated the largest tooth (an incomplete tooth from GLAHM V1129) to be
37.3 mm high apicobasally and 11.4 mm maximum diameter across the root,
no larger teeth were found. Few specimens allow the calculation of
McGowan's [-@McGowan1976 p. 677] tooth index (10 × crown length of
highest tooth/jaw length); Kirton's [-@Kirton1983 p. 70] values were
found to be correct for NHMUK PV R2180, R2181 and GLAHM V1129: 0.140,
0.216 and 0.183 respectively. Higher values are found for smaller
individuals: NHMUK PV R2181 has relatively large teeth that lie in
contact with those alongside; that these teeth point slightly distally
[@Andrews1910] might be due to post-mortem displacement.

The teeth are slightly curved, making the lingual side shorter than the
labial side. The bulbous base forms about two-thirds of the total height
and is compressed transversely, making the base slender and
sub-quadrangular [@Fischer2011c character 3]. This differs from
*Brachypterygius*
([\[BextremusDentition\]](#BextremusDentition){reference-type="ref"
reference="BextremusDentition"}), *Platypterygius*
([1.6.21](#tax:comp:Platypterygius){reference-type="ref"
reference="tax:comp:Platypterygius"}; [@McGowan1972]), and
*Undorosaurus* ([1.6.27](#tax:comp:Undorosaurus){reference-type="ref"
reference="tax:comp:Undorosaurus"}; [@Efimov1999a]), in which the tooth
bases are bulbous and quadrangular, suggesting that the condition is not
homologous between these taxa. There was no bony attachment between the
tooth base and the alveolar groove; the placement of the teeth in the
alveolar groove refers *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* to the aulacodont
dentition of @Mazin1983 and @Motani1997a The root is covered by cementum
that is thinly striated longitudinally by the underlying plication of
the tooth. In this region, the infolding dentine disturbs and breaks up
the pulp cavity and the tooth base assumes bulbous appearance
[@Schultz1969; @Kirton1983]. In NHMUK PV R3893, some replacement teeth
are present and there is resorption of the tooth roots. The replacement
teeth develop lingually and lie in an elongate resorption pit on this
side of the mature tooth root. Apically from the base, the tooth is much
smoother, thinly coated by acellular cementum
[@Andrews1910; @Kirton1983; @Maxwell2011; @Maxwell2012d], and the
cementum is only faintly marked by striations that are continuous with
the crown. This acellular region is visually separated from the crown by
the well-defined base of the enamel [@Fischer2011c character 2], which
forms a clear line around the tooth. The enamelled crown is a straight
cone, circular in cross section, Massare's [-@Massare1987] 'pierce'
guild, with a pointed tip and has further longitudinal striations on the
enamel that are less distinct and finer than on the tooth base. Wear
facets in NHMUK PV R2181 and GLAHM V1129 are found on the distal and
mesial side, likely from abrasion as the interlocking teeth of the upper
and lower jaws were brought together [@Kirton1983]. Further isolated
teeth have been assigned to *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*, but their
generic nature means that it is impossible to be certain that they
derive from this species.

## Hyoid ##

Few examples of the hyoid apparatus are known from *Ophthalmosaurus
icenicus*, or from ichthyosaurs generally. The hyoid apparatus consists
of a pair of curved and transversely compressed, rod-like bones that
would be medial to the jaw rami [@McGowan1973], but whose exact
placement is uncertain. Each end of the hyoid bone is flattened to form
an elongate, elliptical surface that is pitted for the application of
cartilage. @Kirton1983 discussed the homology of these bones, which had
been designated the cornu hyale by @Sollas1916 and @McGowan1973. As this
bone is not ossified in reptiles [@Romer1956], @Kirton1983 instead
homologised the paired hyoid bones with the cornu branchiale I (=
ceratobranchial I), which are ossified and have a similar form (curved
rods) to the bones in *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*. @Sollas1916 recreated
a complex hyoid apparatus, most likely due to disarticulation in the
posterior part of the specimen that he sectioned.

## Atlas-Axis ##

The atlas and axis centra are fused to each other even in the youngest
individuals known; a low vertical ridge marks the remnant of their
separation along the side of the centra
([\[fig:Oicenicus-atlasaxis,pl15\]](#fig:Oicenicus-atlasaxis,pl15){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-atlasaxis,pl15"}). Together the complex has a
triangular shape in anteroposterior view, tapering ventrally. The
anterior face of the atlas is concave for articulation with the
hemispherical boss of the basioccipital, with a central pit in many
specimens, although the anterior face becomes more convex marginally.
Unlike the posterior face of the axis, the anterior surface of the atlas
is slightly irregular, likely indicating where cartilage would have
intervened between the atlas and the basioccipital. This extends around
the anterior face, giving the lateral faces a small anterior rim of
unfinished bone, and further dorsolaterally onto the articulation
surfaces with the neural arches and ribs. Anteroventrally, the atlas is
bevelled (seen well in lateral view), and this might have accommodated a
separate atlantal intercentrum [@Kirton1983]. The irregular surface here
continues onto a ventral cartilage-covered ridge that might have
extended along the first three or four centra (indicated by similarly
rounded and roughened ventral portions). The neural canal is formed by a
shallow channel dorsally on the centrum that is finished in smooth bone
and slightly raised dorsal to the surrounding pitted bone. Lateral to
this, paired pedicels mark the articulation with the atlantal and axial
neural arches; the interior of these facets are slightly excavated to
form a clear rim. The lateral faces of the atlas and axis are each
slightly concave between the anterior and posterior rims and the ridge
marking the suture between the atlas-axis. In lateral view, the axis
appears slightly shorter than the atlas. Placed dorsally, the rib facets
are poorly defined and vary both between individuals and between the
right and left sides of a single specimen (e.g.  GLAHM V1916;
[1.13](#fig:Oicenicus-atlasaxis){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-atlasaxis"}). The diapophyses are broad, pitted
areas, subtriangular in shape, placed dorsally and anteriorly on both
the atlas and axis and are often confluent with the neural arch facets.
The parapophyses form lower, rounded plinths that are situated towards
the posterior margins of the atlas and axis. @Kirton1983 noted that the
diapophysis and parapophysis may amalgamate into a poorly defined,
raised surface of pitted bone ( GLAHM V1061 and V1611). These features
arise from the low degree of ossification, particularly around the
anterior articular surfaces. The posterior face of the axis is more
deeply concave than the anterior face of the atlas, and also smoother
and more sharply defined. The posterior articular face of the axis is
smaller than the anterior face of the atlas, and tapers greatly
ventrally. This occurs gradually through the whole complex so that the
axis forms a narrow ventromedial keel, giving the bone a heart shape in
posterior view, and this is continued caudally by the next centrum. An
axial intercentrum ossification does not seem to have been present.
Together, the atlas-axis complex has a slight posterodorsal inclination,
so that the more posterior centra are more dorsally positioned and
continue the rise towards the trunk.

The atlas and axis neural arches and spines are about one-half and
two-thirds the height of their centra respectively, lower than the more
posterior cervical and dorsal neural spines; both are unfused to the
centra. Unlike all more posterior neural arches, the atlantal neural
arch is ossified in two halves that are in contact medially; all other
arches are fused along the midline
([1.13](#fig:Oicenicus-atlasaxis){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-atlasaxis"}; *contra*
[@Andrews1910; @Kirton1983]). Each half of the atlantal neural arch is
composed of a robust ventral column that is rounded ventrally for
articulation with the centrum. This pedicel is deflected medially and
narrows into the blade-like neural spine, which meets its counterpart
medially. Between the two sides, the articular surface is a broad
flattened area, separated from the ventral column by an oblique ridge.
This is separated from the more posterior portion of the surface that
forms the overlap with the axial neural spine by a faint, subvertical
ridge. The columnar part of the arch forks around the neural spine
providing surfaces anteriorly and posteriorly for the zygapophyses. A
small anterior tubercle might have articulated with a proatlas
[@Kirton1983]. Posteriorly, the two halves of the neural spine remain
deeply separated and the postzygapophyses are elongate and slightly
curved. In articulation, the atlas and axis neural arches overlap
distinctly, but do not fuse, unlike in *Ophthalmosaurus natans*
[@Druckenmiller2010 character 26]. The axial neural spine is fused
medially, but retains a pronounced medial ridge and deeply split
posterior edge that allows great overlap of the third cervical vertebral
neural arch. Its form is similar to the atlas neural arch, but is
taller, particularly in the spine, and has more highly developed
zygapophyses. These begin to take the form found through much of the
rest of the vertebral column: large elliptical surfaces raised dorsal to
the neural spine, although each side remains clearly separate from the
other. At its distal tip, the axial spine is grooved where cartilage
would have capped it. The atlantal and axial neural spines are
noticeably posteriorly deflected, more so than in more posterior neural
arches.

## Vertebral Column ##

The vertebral column of *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* shows weak
regionalisation in the size and shape of the centra
([1.14](#fig:Oicenicus-vertratios){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-vertratios"}). No specimen shows the entirety
of the vertebral column: the small, posterior fluke centra are
frequently lost, and many other specimens have been crushed to some
extent or disarticulated so that the true positions are lost.
@Kirton1983 identified CAMSM J63920--64037 as the most complete
exemplar, while @Buchholtz2001 described PETMG R340 as complete from
anterior to the mid-fluke region; it is likely that *Ophthalmosaurus
icenicus* had a total of around 130 vertebrae. Regional division of the
column is hampered by the continuous and variable positions of the
neural arch and rib facets, but is generally split into two portions:
presacral and caudal, based upon the position of the ilium
[@McGowan2003]. The caudal region may be further subdivided with the
position of the tailbend -- the apical region -- separating the anterior
preflexural portion of the tail from the posterior postflexural portion.
As the pelvic girdle is not sutured to the vertebral column, the
position of the sacral region can be difficult to determine.
@Andrews1910 used the point at which the diapophysis and parapophysis
join to mark the first 'caudal' vertebra as a reference. This might not
be the true position of the sacrum, although @Kirton1983 proposed it lay
around the 42^nd^ vertebra as there is a sudden increase in central
height in this region in adult specimens. @Buchholtz2001 suggested a
count of around 39 presacral vertebrae, using neural canal width; a
method derived from measurements on other ichthyosaurs. @Appleby1956
further separated the 'cervical' vertebrae, those up to where the neural
arch facet and diapophysis lose contact, some 20--25 vertebrae, which
extend posterior to the pectoral girdle. McGowan & Motani's
[-@McGowan2003] terminology is employed in the description of the
vertebral column. Additionally, the presacral vertebrae are divided
based upon contact between the neural arch facet and diapophysis into
anterior (contact is present) and posterior (contact is absent)
portions, Kirton's [-@Kirton1983] anterior and posterior trunk vertebrae
respectively. Thunnosaurian ichthyosaurs mostly have around 40--45
presacral vertebrae, but this is greater in mixosaurids, which have
45--50, and up to 60 in *Cymbospondylus petrinus* [@Merriam1908]. The
length of the vertebral column, and the distinctiveness of the
vertebrae, particularly centra, means that these are the most commonly
occurring ichthyosaur elements. In some places, vertebrae are the only
incidence of ichthyosaur material
[@Huene1931a; @Huene1936; @Kuhn-Schnyder1980]. Early research frequently
used slight differences in vertebral morphology, often attributable to
intraspecific or intracolumnar variation of form along the axis, to
define taxa [e.g. @Owen1840; @Phillips1871]; many of these are now
considered invalid (see [1.5.2](#Taxainvalida){reference-type="ref"

## Presacral Vertebrae ##

Around 40 presacral vertebrae are present in *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*,
based upon estimates of the pelvic girdle position (39--42;
[@Kirton1983; @Buchholtz2001]), which occurs just anterior to where the
diapophysis and parapophysis join (approximately at vertebra 45:
[@Andrews1910]) (; ). The centra immediately posterior to the atlas-axis
rapidly decrease in height, but posterior to the axis there is a gradual
increase in centrum height throughout the presacral column
([1.14](#fig:Oicenicus-vertratios){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-vertratios"}; [@Buchholtz2001]). The centra
become slightly longer towards the middle of the presacral region,
around vertebra 25. The centra of the few vertebrae directly posterior
to the atlas-axis complex are similarly heart-shaped: keeled ventrally
and more square dorsally. This keel rapidly becomes less well developed
on more caudal vertebrae, so that by vertebrae six to eight the centrum
is almost circular; this keel may have formed the attachment point for
sub-vertebral muscles [@Kirton1983].

Posterior to the reduction of the ventral keel, the presacral vertebrae
are discoidal throughout the rest of the series; the anterior and
posterior faces are straight-sided in lateral view. Each centrum is
strongly amphicoelous, with small pits placed centrally, but the face of
the anterior and posterior face concavities is convex, so that vertebral
centrum has an hourglass-shape in sagittal cross-section. This form is
typical of post-Triassic ichthyosaurs, and similar vertebrae have been
figured by @Kiprijanoff1881 [pl. 1 @Fraas1891 pl. 14, figs 5b, 6b].
Ventral to the neural canal, the centrum is slightly thickened to form a
triangular convexity that is separate from the more continuous
convex-concave face that forms the rest of the centrum depression. This
convexity is indistinct, extending from the centre of the centrum face,
and is bounded by two slight grooves that are directed towards each of
the neural arch facets dorsolaterally. That this is present across
several vertebrae and specimens suggests that this is not a form of
pathology [@Stepanov2004]. The thickening of the centrum would have
resisted the compressive forces applied to the vertebral column
[@Kirton1983]. Dorsally, the centrum has a wide longitudinal canal that
forms the floor of the neural canal. The surface of the floor of the
neural canal is roughened, with longitudinal striations. The neural
canal is bordered laterally by the two neural arch facets, which are
raised dorsal to the neural canal to form pedestals. These facets are
narrow but anteroposteriorly elongate, extending from the anterior to
posterior margin on the dorsal surface, with a deep concavity centrally
into which the neural spine was located. The surface of the neural arch
facet is pitted as cartilage would have intervened in the articulation.
Laterally from the convexities, the neural arch facets in the anterior
*c.* 25 vertebral centra are confluent with the diapophysis of the
bicipital rib facet (see
[\[OicenicusRibs\]](#OicenicusRibs){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusRibs"}). The diapophysis is positioned towards the
anterior of the centrum and takes the form of a large, raised, and
rounded articulation. The surface of the diapophysis is pitted for
application of cartilage, continued from the neural arch facet medially.
The size of the diapophysis in these anterior centra, where it is
confluent with the neural arch facet, gives the dorsal portion of the
centrum a slightly square shape in anterior or posterior view; this is
particularly evident in the centra immediately following the atlas-axis
complex. Around vertebra 25, the diapophysis begins to separate from the
neural arch facet. The parapophysis, the ventral articulation of the
bicipital rib facet, is a smaller tubercle that is positioned about
halfway down the lateral centrum, against the anterior margin in the
anterior vertebrae; its surface is also pitted for the application of
cartilage. This tubercle migrates posteriorly on the lateral face of the
centrum up to vertebra 25, but maintains connection with the anterior
margin by a low, roughened ridge. The lateral and ventral faces of the
centrum are continuous and anteroposteriorly concave throughout. This
concavity is accentuated by the anterior and posterior margins forming
raised lips that border the lateral and ventral surfaces. The lateral
and ventral surfaces are smooth and pitted by numerous nutritive
foramina. Between approximately vertebrae 25 and 38, the diapophysis,
separate from the neural arch facet, and parapophysis rapidly migrate
ventrally on the side of the centrum to the ventrolateral corner, and
become slightly closer to each other. In the last few of these
vertebrae, the rib facets maintain their separation.

Posterior to vertebra 39, the diapophysis shrinks and migrates ventrally
towards the parapophysis, joining with it to form an
anterodorsally--posteroventrally elongate synapophysis around vertebrae
42--43; Kirton's [-@Kirton1983] definition of the presacral/caudal
boundary. At this point, the ribs become unicipital (see
[\[OicenicusRibs\]](#OicenicusRibs){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusRibs"}). In the posterior presacral to anterior
caudal regions, with the rib articulations placed ventrolaterally, the
ventral margin of the centrum is much straighter than in the more
anterior and posterior centra. In the aforementioned region, the ventral
edges of the centra begin to develop a low, keel-like ridge along the
midline. This keel becomes more strongly developed in posterior
vertebrae, particularly into the caudal series (see
[\[OicenicusCaudalvertebrae\]](#OicenicusCaudalvertebrae){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusCaudalvertebrae"}), but between about vertebrae
29--36, the keel is divided by a median groove [@Kirton1983]. Some
specimens preserve lithified intercentral discs along with the bony
vertebrae; these would have likely been poorly ossified or cartilaginous
in life. The intercentral discs are thin and biconvex, moulding the
amphicoelous nature of the centra. They would have filled the space
between the vertebrae, but would not have created any large separation
between vertebrae: the margin of the centrum faces would likely have
been nearly in contact. This would have allowed little movement over
much of the vertebral column, which would have prevented the majority of
the skeleton from participating in axial propulsion. Similar
intercentral discs have been reported in *Ophthalmosaurus natans*, which
increase in length posteriorly -- separating the vertebral centra -- to
the middle caudal region, decreasing further posteriorly [@Massare2006].
It is uncertain whether this was the case in *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*,
however, *Acamptonectes densus* shows 'locking' of the
[S]{.sans-serif}-shaped vertebral facets in the cervical and dorsal
regions [@Fischer2012].

The neural arches too retain a similar form through much of the
presacral region, taking the form of tall, squared projections that are
deflected slightly posteriorly
([\[fig:Oicenicus-anteriornspines,fig:Oicenicus-posteriornspines,pl18\]](#fig:Oicenicus-anteriornspines,fig:Oicenicus-posteriornspines,pl18){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-anteriornspines,fig:Oicenicus-posteriornspines,pl18"}).
Caudal to the atlas-axis complex, they rapidly increase in height until
vertebra six. These first few neural arches resemble the arches of the
atlas-axis complex, with rather narrow bases and slightly posteriorly
deflected neural spines. In lateral view, the arches are formed by the
anteroposteriorly elongate columns, more widely separated than in the
atlas-axis complex, that have slightly convex and roughened bases for
articulation with the neural arch facets on the centra. Dorsal to this
articulation, the arches rapidly converge towards the midline, enclosing
the neural canal ventrally and meeting at less than one-quarter of the
height of the neural spine. The prezygapophyses and postzygapophyses are
positioned largely dorsal to the neural arch and canal, but the
ventralmost portion does diverge around the dorsal of the neural arch.
Longitudinally, along its posterior margin, the neural spine is grooved,
possibly marking the point of fusion of separate ossification centres
[@Kirton1983], into which the sharp ridge of the anterior margin of the
following neural spine slots. This creates a sharp midline peak
longitudinally in the roof of the neural canal that divides the pre- and
postzygapophyses into two elongate articular areas just lateral to the
midline of the neural spine. The prezygapophyseal articulations face
anterodorsally, whereas the postzygapophyses face posteroventrally to
contact the prezygapophyses from the vertebra posteriorly. @Kirton1983
[80] suggested that the overlapping of these neural arches would have
restricted movement of the cervical region. The neural arch is thin and
elongate, with a square dorsal margin in lateral view. Dorsally, along
the entirety of the presacral portion of the axial column, the neural
spine is grooved longitudinally and would have been continued in
cartilage. Posterior to vertebra six, the margins of the neural arches
become more rounded, particularly towards the dorsal part of the neural
canal; there is little evidence of separate ossification of the lateral
halves. The lateral pedicels of the arches converge more rapidly dorsal
to the neural canal and the neural spine dorsally in this region is
narrower. Both the pre- and postzygapophyses are situated entirely
dorsal to the neural canal and meet at the midline. The ridges and
grooves found in the most anterior neural spines are reduced here. The
prezygapophyses are bilobate, retaining a median ridge and sightly
concave; the postzygapophyses are more completely joined, with a less
obvious median groove, and form a large elongate articular surface. In
the presacral vertebrae, the neural spines are deflected slightly
posteriorly relative to the vertical axis through the centrum; this
reflects the curved nature of the axis in creating the fusiform body
shape [@Kirton1983]. As the centrum length increases towards vertebra
25, so the length of the neural arches increases in lateral view, but
the neural spines decrease in height in more posterior vertebrae towards
the caudal region.

[\[OicenicusCaudalvertebrae\]]{#OicenicusCaudalvertebrae
label="OicenicusCaudalvertebrae"}

From the point where the diapophysis and parapophysis join, the tail
vertebrae gradually change shape posteriorly towards the apical region
and caudal fluke
([\[fig:Oicenicus-antcaudalvert,fig:Oicenicus-apicalcentra,pl18\]](#fig:Oicenicus-antcaudalvert,fig:Oicenicus-apicalcentra,pl18){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-antcaudalvert,fig:Oicenicus-apicalcentra,pl18"}).
The centra in the anterior portion of the caudal series remain large,
with a similar form to the most posterior presacral centra, but become
shorter anteroposteriorly, so that they have a more discoidal form.
@Kirton1983 [81--82] interpreted this as allowing more flexibility and
as an important region in generating thrust during axial propulsion. As
the centra become shorter, the synapophysis takes up relatively more of
the anteroposterior length of the centrum. It eventually becomes
confluent with both the anterior and posterior margins of the centrum,
and is here somewhat thickened, so taking on an externally square shape,
although the articulation remains rounded. The ventrolateral keels on
the centra (see
[\[OicenicusPresacralvertebrae\]](#OicenicusPresacralvertebrae){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusPresacralvertebrae"}) become higher and narrow,
appearing sharper, in the more posterior vertebrae, with two foramina
piercing the surface between the keels by vertebra 50, each slightly
lateral to the midline. The anterior and posterior margins of the
centrum between these keels are narrow, but widen either side into what
@Kirton1983 [82] interpreted as facets for the haemal arches. These
facets become more pronounced by vertebra 60, whereas the keel becomes
reduced. From approximately vertebra 55, centrum height starts to
decrease, this decrease becoming much more rapid from vertebra 66
towards the caudal fluke. These centra, however, become proportionally
wider and the rib articulation migrates slightly dorsally up each side
of the centrum, towards the middle.

The apical region tail bend is created by a series of five modified,
procoelous vertebrae, around vertebrae 71--75, termed apical centra
[@McGowan2003]. This procoely is partially created by a strong rounding
of the centrum margins on both the anterior and posterior faces, but
each retains a central pit. The irregular surface of the apical
vertebrae suggests a large covering of these centra in cartilage. In
more strongly ossified individuals, the procoely becomes more pronounced
so that the anterior face of the centrum becomes strongly convex and
articulates with the posterior face of the preceding centrum in a
ball-and-socket joint that allows a great range of motion in the apical
region @Kirton1983. The first centrum in this series is sub-circular,
like the centra immediately anterior to it, but posteriorly, the centra
rapidly become narrower and [U]{.sans-serif}-shaped in anterior and
posterior views. Dorsally, the neural arch facets become more prominent,
and the neural canal between these facets narrows and deepens slightly
into a deep median channel, accentuating the overall
[U]{.sans-serif}-shape. Rib facets are present on the anterior three
apical centra only, halfway down the lateral faces and positioned
posteriorly, but with raised ridges connecting to both the anterior and
posterior margins of the centrum; all centra posterior to this lack rib
facets. In addition, these apical centra are slightly wedge-shaped, with
ventral margins shorter than the dorsal margins, creating distinct
ventral flexion, over several vertebrae, that separates the caudal fluke
vertebrae. @McGowan1989b [430] used trigonometry to measure the angle
subtended by each apical centrum in *Eurhinosaurus longirostris* and
*Leptonectes tenuirostris*, calculating values of 2--5° per centrum.
Similar calculations for *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* yield a more
constant value of about 1.5° in PETMG R340
([1.21](#fig:Oicenicus-apicalcentra){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-apicalcentra"}). However, as the centra are
more rounded in *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*, compared to wedges in the
above taxa, this might mean that the tail bend had a stronger
deflection, and greater overall mobility. Disarticulation of the
available material means that the true amount of deflection of the tail
fin is unknown. Posterior to the apical vertebrae, the centra of the
tail fin retain a [U]{.sans-serif}-shape, but become more flat faced,
the anterior and posterior faces are neither as concave as in the
anterior vertebrae, nor as convex as the tail bend centra. The caudal
fluke is supported ventrally by 50--60 vertebrae that decrease in size
posteriorly into tiny discs; the terminal elements become so small that
they are either not preserved or cannot be collected. Unlike the more
anterior centra, these are more completely ossified and sharply defined.
Many of these are aligned straight, with parallel anterior and posterior
margins in lateral view, but @Kirton1983 [85] identified distal elements
in CAMSM J63920--64037 that show a slight wedge shape, opposite to that
of the tail bend, indicating a distal recurve. There are no rib facets
present on these centra, but neural arch facets are present as dorsal
pedestals, with the neural canal running in between. The ventrally
raised areas, interpreted as haemal arch facets, persists throughout the
caudal region.

Unlike the centra, the neural arches and spines rapidly decrease in
height in the anterior caudal region
([\[fig:Oicenicus-posteriornspines,fig:Oicenicus-apicalnspines\]](#fig:Oicenicus-posteriornspines,fig:Oicenicus-apicalnspines){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-posteriornspines,fig:Oicenicus-apicalnspines"}).
The arches become lower and the spines shorter so that the posterior
elements have a regular triradiate form. The pre- and postzygapophyses
decrease in size more anteriorly than the neural spine, and are reduced
to small, sub-circular areas positioned directly dorsal to the neural
canal. Most noticeably, the neural spines steadily become deflected more
posteriorly in the posterior caudal vertebrae as they are reduced, so
that both sets of zygapophyses are nearly horizontal by about vertebra
66 and the neural spine overlaps the spine of the more posterior
vertebra. Throughout the caudal region, the neural spines retain a
groove in the dorsal margin. In the apical region, the neural spines are
wider and strongly bulbous dorsally, with strongly roughened and pitted
surfaces, suggesting a large amount of ligamentous connective tissue
[@Kirton1983 84]. There is no development of the zygapophyses, and these
neural arches were unlikely to have been in contact, allowing motion in
the apical region. Few neural arches are preserved from vertebrae
posterior to the apical region, but these caudal fluke neural spines
show a similar, albeit diminishing, form. Neural arch facets are present
on the vertebral centra in much of the fluke region, but the respective
arches were likely very small and may have been lost, or possibly not
ossified. The lateral ventral keels, and associated thickening of the
centrum margins in the caudal region, interpreted as facets for the
haemal arches (see above), continues along much of the tail bend too. No
elements can be certainly identified as haemal arches, and these were
likely poorly ossified also, as supported by the poorly defined facets.

[\[OicenicusRibs\]]{#OicenicusRibs label="OicenicusRibs"}

The ribs follow the same poor regionalisation as the vertebrae
([\[fig:Oicenicus-ribs\]](#fig:Oicenicus-ribs){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-ribs"}). Rib facets on the vertebral centra
show that ribs were present on all vertebrae up to the apical region, at
about the 73^rd^ vertebra. In the anterior region of the vertebral
column, the ribs possess two proximal heads: the tuberculum and
capitulum, articulating with the diapophysis and parapophysis on the
vertebral centra respectively. The tuberculum and capitulum are
flattened and pitted for application of cartilage. The large capitulum
is aligned with the proximal part of the rib shaft, whereas the
tuberculum is smaller and deflected dorsally, creating a
[Y]{.sans-serif}-shaped proximal dichotomy. In articulation, this means
that the proximal portion of the rib is angled dorsolaterally, before
curving ventrally in its distal portion. This gives *Ophthalmosaurus
icenicus* a broad body in anteroposterior view, which @McGowan2003 [19]
described as "barrel-chested". The dorsal and ventral margins of the rib
are roughened and would have provided attachment for muscles.
Proximally, the anterior rib shafts are strongly curved, but this
becomes less marked distally. The ribs are flattened anteroposteriorly
for much of their length, but become rounded distally. Longitudinal
grooves run for between one-half and two-thirds of the proximal length
of the rib on both the anterior and posterior faces, beginning at the
midline and moving towards the internal margin distally. In the
posterior presacral ribs, the tubercula are reduced and the two proximal
heads of the rib become closer. Between the tuberculum and capitulum, a
thin sheet of bone develops, similar in form to webbing between digits.
The ribs in this region also become shorter and less strongly curved;
distally, the ribs taper. On the anterior face, at the apex where the
capitulum and tuberculum separate, a small muscle tubercle is developed.
The tuberculum and capitulum finally join to form a single-headed rib,
with an elongate articulation, in the sacral region: around vertebra 43,
where the diapophysis and synapophysis join (see
[\[OicenicusPresacralvertebrae\]](#OicenicusPresacralvertebrae){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusPresacralvertebrae"}). There is no evidence for
connection with the pelvic girdle or specialisation of the ribs in this
region. The ribs of the caudal region are shorter and taper distally.
The proximal head of the rib is aligned slightly
posterodorsally--anteroventrally, and the rib is directed
ventrolaterally and slightly posteriorly. These ribs have a weakly
developed anterior groove and very poorly developed groove posteriorly;
the distal end is tipped by cartilage. At the posterior end of the
vertebral column, the ribs are shorter and develop as horizontally
flattened nubbins of bone, distally roughened and presumably finished in
cartilage
([\[fig:Oicenicus-ribs\]](#fig:Oicenicus-ribs){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-ribs"}).

[\[OicenicusGastralia\]]{#OicenicusGastralia label="OicenicusGastralia"}

Gastralia are uncommon in the material of the Leeds Collection, but
several examples from *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* are known. Fragments
are preserved in GLAHM V1916 and more complete examples are present in
NHMUK PV R8737. The gastralia are thin, gently curved rods of bone, with
diameters varying from 3.85--7.50 mm in the latter specimen. The lengths
of individual gastralia varies from around 150--290 mm, the longer ones
probably coming from the middle part of the torso. Each gastralium is
sub-circular in cross-section through its midpoint, but at each end
becomes flattened for articulation. The articulations between the
gastralia are ridged longitudinally and the elements here overlap. The
curve of the rod largely occurs in the middle third of its length, each
more distal portion being noticeably straighter. The larger gastralia
show a curve of 140--150° over their length, although the shorter
elements display smaller angles. Some elements show a reversing of the
curve distally. Although NHMUK PV R8737 preserves many gastralia, a
complete set cannot be reconstructed, and as the gastralia are
disarticulated, it is difficult to restore their true relationship to
the dorsal rib cage.

The pectoral girdle in *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* is large, robust, and
provided a large area for the attachment of musculature associated with
the large forelimbs (see ;
[1.23](#fig:Oicenicus-pectoral){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-pectoral"}). In spite of this, the bones of the
pectoral girdle would have been surrounded by a thick layer of cartilage
in life, and variable degrees of ossification has caused differences in
the morphology of these pectoral elements, particularly the coracoids
and scapulae [see @Maxwell2011b fig. 3]. This variation has reduced the
taxonomic utility of the pectoral elements, but as robust elements, they
are often found, and detailed description is warranted. @Maxwell2011b
have discussed the taxonomic utility of the pectoral girdle in other
Jurassic ichthyosaur taxa, concluding that the generic form of the
pectoral girdle found in ophthalmosaurids shows no phylogenetically
informative characters to this clade, and only four are applicable to
Parvipelvia [@Fernandez2007; @Fischer2013a].

[\[OicenicusClavicle\]]{#OicenicusClavicle label="OicenicusClavicle"}

The clavicles are elongate and curved, strap-like bones that meet
medially in a complex, interdigitating suture, but do not overlap
([\[fig:Oicenicus-pectoral,pl19\]](#fig:Oicenicus-pectoral,pl19){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-pectoral,pl19"}). @Seeley1874) did not think
that the clavicles met, but were separated, because the clavicles in the
holotype (NHMUK PV R2133) are incomplete medially. This contact between
the two clavicles is not complete, as the two clavicles diverge to
expose a tuberosity on the interclavicle (see
[\[OicenicusInterclavicle\]](#OicenicusInterclavicle){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusInterclavicle"}). There is no fusion between the two
clavicles at their midline, or with the underlying interclavicle, except
in the largest individuals (e.g.  NHMUK PV R3535). Where this does
occur, the closeness of the fusion makes it difficult to follow the
suture [@Kirton1983]. The anterior face of the clavicle is convex and
smooth along most of its surface, except anteromedially. It is likely
that there would have been many muscles connected here
[@Johnson1979; @Kirton1983], although there is no strong indication of
scarring on the surface. Medially, the clavicle is broad and straight,
but curves dorsally in its lateral portion. The distal portion narrows
greatly to form a tapering horn-like extension that curves dorsally to
meet the proximal scapula.

The posterior surface of the clavicle is deeply grooved medially and
would have been applied to the anterior face of the horizontal bar of
the interclavicle in life. The surface of the clavicle is roughened and
striated for this contact. Ventrally, the clavicle has a strongly raised
ridge that holds the ventral part of the horizontal bar of the
interclavicle. The posterior groove shallows laterally, particularly as
the clavicle is deflected dorsally into an irregular channel, into which
the acromion process of the scapula fits. Towards the lateral, horn-like
extension, the ventral edge is sharply angled laterally in some
specimens (e.g.  PETMG R220), but may be straighter in others (e.g. 
NHMUK PV R2149). A depression here fits onto the anterior edge of the
scapula, separated from the acromion facet anteriorly [@Appleby1956],
and the surface is roughened for contact with the scapula.

[\[OicenicusInterclavicle\]]{#OicenicusInterclavicle
label="OicenicusInterclavicle"}

In *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*, the interclavicle is
[T]{.sans-serif}-shaped and sits posterior to the clavicular arch and
anterior to the coracoids
([\[fig:Oicenicus-pectoral,pl20\]](#fig:Oicenicus-pectoral,pl20){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-pectoral,pl20"}). The [T]{.sans-serif} of the
interclavicle consists of a transverse bar anteriorly, with a
posteriorly-directed medial stem. The stem is usually longer than the
transverse bar (e.g.  NHMUK PV R4753), although in some smaller, and
presumably juvenile specimens (e.g.  LEICT 100'1949/27) this is greatly
reduced; the latter specimen also has a median suture. Anteriorly, the
clavicles cover the transverse bar, which is convex to fit into the
posterior groove of the clavicles (see
[\[OicenicusClavicle\]](#OicenicusClavicle){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusClavicle"}) and each end tapers distally. The
surface of the interclavicle is roughened and grooved, corresponding to
the interior surface of the clavicle. A tuberosity is variably developed
on the midline of the interclavicle that protrudes through a gap between
the articulated clavicles. @Kirton1983 suggested this might have been a
point of muscle attachment to the forelimb. The ventral edge of the
transverse bar curves gently posteriorly to join the stem to the
transverse bar. This narrows slightly into a neck, but then widens
distally to form an elongate lateral flange. Proximally, the stem is
convex laterally, becoming flatter distally as it becomes wider
[@Andrews1910]. Around the distal flange, a small ridge demarcates the
edge, which tapers distally. The surface of this stem is roughened and
longitudinally striated, particularly distally, and may have been the
location for further muscle attachment. Along the midline of some
specimens (e.g.  NHMUK PV R4753), proximally, is a low median ridge that
extends for about one-third of the length of the stem of the
interclavicle; again this may have provided a point for muscle
attachment.

Internally, the anterior interclavicle is raised into a ridge dorsally
that fits into the posterior groove on the clavicular arch (see
[\[OicenicusClavicle\]](#OicenicusClavicle){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusClavicle"}. This creates a channel posterodorsally
along the transverse bar of the interclavicle that becomes less
pronounced distally. The surface of this channel is rugose, although the
posterior margin of the transverse bar may be smoother. Medially, the
channel narrows posteriorly into a groove along the stem of the
interclavicle, narrowing further in the neck. The surface of this groove
is strongly striated longitudinally, but the channel broadens distally,
and the striations cover the entirety of the distal flange. On this
surface, the roughening likely indicates the application of cartilage or
ligaments that intervened between the interclavicle and coracoid
[@Kirton1983]. Only in well-ossified individuals can a slight facet be
seen on the coracoid (see
[\[OicenicusCoracoid\]](#OicenicusCoracoid){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusCoracoid"}; [@Andrews1910; @Kirton1983]).

[\[OicenicusCoracoid\]]{#OicenicusCoracoid label="OicenicusCoracoid"}

The coracoid, like the scapula, has a large variation in the degree of
ossification and resulting morphology
([\[fig:Oicenicus-pectoral,fig:Oicenicus-coracoid,pl20,pl21\]](#fig:Oicenicus-pectoral,fig:Oicenicus-coracoid,pl20,pl21){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-pectoral,fig:Oicenicus-coracoid,pl20,pl21"}).
The coracoid is a large, ovoid plate-like bone with a rounded
embayment-like notch laterally on the anterior border. Two broad and
oblique elongate facets are developed laterally and medially that give
this bone a saddle shape: concave mediolaterally and convex
anteroposteriorly. Almost the entire margin of the coracoidal plate is
roughened and pitted, and with a slight groove indicating that it was
likely surrounded by cartilage in life. Anteromedially, the coracoid
projects forward into a broad, rounded process, where the marginal
groove is particularly well developed. This portion of the coracoid, and
the surrounding cartilage, would have come close to, or been fully
articulated with the clavicles anteriorly (see
[\[OicenicusClavicle\]](#OicenicusClavicle){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusClavicle"}). Larger specimens have a triangular
pitted region that would contact with the median stem of the
interclavicle. The anterior notch forms lateral to this process,
separating it from the lateral articular facet. The bone of the margin
is smooth and rounded around the margin of the notch, unlike around the
rest of the coracoid. Neither the dorsal nor ventral surfaces of the
coracoid have any strong features on them. As mentioned above, they are
both gently warped between the medial and lateral facets into a saddle
shape. @Kirton1983 noted that the intercoracoidal facet is drawn
dorsally and markedly raised dorsal to the dorsal surface, higher than
the ventral portion, aiding in orienting and diagnosing the coracoid
when it is disarticulated.

Much of the medial margin is broadened into a large, elliptical facet
that articulates with the contralateral coracoid. The facet faces
slightly dorsally, so that the long axis of the coracoids would be at an
angle of *c.* 125° in articulation [@Kirton1983]. However, the surface
of the facet is strongly rugose and irregularly pitted throughout on
both coracoids indicating that much cartilage was present, intervening
in the articulation. Some coracoids may fit well and closely, however,
in some specimens the intercoracoidal facet is convex, so the two
elements fit less closely (e.g. LEICT 100'1949/21). This makes it hard
to determine the true angle between the coracoids in life. A similar
facet is present on the coracoid laterally, also heavily pitted and
slightly concave posteriorly to receive the proximal humerus
[@Seeley1874]. This is generally not as strongly developed
dorsoventrally as the intercoracoidal facet, and is oriented more
perpendicular to the body of the coracoid. The anterior, triangular
portion of the lateral facet is separated and slightly angled forward
(*c.* 135°; [@Andrews1910]) to articulate with the coracoid facet of
scapula (see
[\[OicenicusScapula\]](#OicenicusScapula){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusScapula"}). The size of the scapular facet is
variable, but is often less than one-third the length of the lateral
articular surface of the coracoid. When articulated, the median portion
of the proximal margin of the scapula would have been placed against the
anterior notch of the coracoid. This forms a fenestra that is also
bordered anteriorly by the clavicles and probably was surrounded
anteriorly by cartilage, although @Andrews1910 did not think that the
scapular and coracoidal cartilages met. Johnson ([-@Johnson1979], [after
@Furbringer1876]) referred to this as the *fenestra coracoscapularis*.
Although this is not likely to be homologous to the coracoscapular
fenestra in extant lizards, it might also be associated with the
*M. scapulohumeralis anterior*, which attaches to the proximal scapula
[@Romer1956; @Kirton1983; @Maxwell2011b]. Posterior to this, the larger
part of the articular surface of the lateral facet on the coracoid forms
the coracoidal portion of the glenoid articulation, opposite the
scapular contribution. @Kirton1983 [p. 90] noted that, in articulation,
the scapula and coracoid do not form a well defined socket for the
humeral insertion, unlike in *Stenopterygius* [@Johnson1979]. A large
amount of cartilage was present between the scapula, coracoid, and
humerus, so the true orientation of the latter cannot be determined. The
posterior margin of the coracoid is variably rounded, connecting the
medial and lateral facets: NHMUK PV R2148 has a straighter margin
laterally, whereas NHMUK PV R2149 is regularly rounded, almost
semicircular. Some coracoids from well-ossified individuals (e.g.  CAMSM
J63920) have a small excavation posterior to the glenoid articulation
that may be surfaced in finished bone. This small excavation forms a
slight concavity in the posterior margin of the coracoid, although not
to the extent of the anterior notch or the posterior notch in the
holotype (NHMUK PV R2133) and LEICT 100'1949/20 (see
[\[OicenicusDiscussion\]](#OicenicusDiscussion){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusDiscussion"}).

[\[OicenicusScapula\]]{#OicenicusScapula label="OicenicusScapula"}

Proximally, the scapula takes part in the glenoid articulation with the
coracoid and is expanded posteriorly for this structure
([\[fig:Oicenicus-pectoral,pl21\]](#fig:Oicenicus-pectoral,pl21){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-pectoral,pl21"}, figs 5--8). The more distal
portion narrows into a strap-like shank that is directed
posterodorsally. The proximal end of the scapula is deeply pitted and
has an elongate and shallow [S]{.sans-serif}-shape, which may be
grooved, in proximal view. This surface is expanded posteriorly into a
teardrop-like area that is straight medially, and convex laterally. This
area articulates with the coracoid (forward portion) to form the glenoid
facet, for which the scapula is greatly widened and heavily rugose: it
is likely that much cartilage would have intervened in the glenoid
articulation between the scapula, coracoid and the proximal humerus.
Anteriorly, the proximal margin is strongly deflected laterally to form
the acromion process, which forms a roughened ridge along the proximal
one-half of the anterior margin of the scapula that may have been
covered by cartilage. The middle section of the proximal margin is the
thinnest part and was positioned opposite the anterior notch of the
coracoid in life. This middle section of the proximal articulation of
the scapula would not have directly articulated with the coracoid, but
rather may have continued the cartilage surrounding the anterior notch
of the coracoid posteriorly (see
[\[OicenicusCoracoid\]](#OicenicusCoracoid){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusCoracoid"}). This portion of the proximal margin is
usually roughened like the rest of the proximal scapular margin.
However, in a few specimens (e.g.  NHMUK PV R2140, R2152 and R2160;
[\[pl21\]](#pl21){reference-type="ref" reference="pl21"}) the bone is
smoothed to a rounded and slightly concave edge. The anterior margin of
the scapula is convex in lateral view and often continuously curved. In
more heavily ossified individuals, this is more strongly angled,
separating the positions of the acromion process, midsection and
coracoid and glenoid facets more clearly.

Posterior to the anterior curve of the [S]{.sans-serif}-shape of the
anterior margin, the scapula is concave laterally, shallowing distally
between the converging arms of the acromion process anteriorly and the
expanded posterior facet. This concavity may have been the location of
muscles connected to the humerus (*M. scapulohumeralis anterior*:
[@Maxwell2011b]), although there is little evidence of discrete
attachment positions. The anterior margin of the scapula was gently
concave and was covered anteriorly by the internal (posterodorsal) face
of the distal clavicle (see
[\[OicenicusClavicle\]](#OicenicusClavicle){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusClavicle"}). Much of its surface is roughened and
slightly flattened (e.g.  PETMG R220) where it would fit into the
posterodorsal channel of the clavicle
[@Seeley1874; @Andrews1910; @Appleby1956]. The sharper posterior margin
of the scapula is strongly concave in lateral view, particularly
proximally, and forms a clear neck in the scapula that separates the
proximal, articular portion and the distal blade. This blade is slightly
curved dorsomedially around the rib cage, becoming slightly thinner
distally, but may largely retain its dorsoventral height throughout
(e.g. the holotype: NHMUK PV R2133), or may significantly broaden (e.g. 
NHMUK PV R2139 and R2140). Distally, the scapula is squared off, but
this margin, and the surrounding bone, is pitted and grooved indicating
that it would be continued by cartilage in life, the extent of which is
uncertain. Laterally, the surface of the scapula is generally roughened,
with rugose areas marking the attachment points of pectoral muscles. It
is difficult to determine the true locations of muscle attachment, as
has been attempted for *Stenopterygius* [@Johnson1979], as the requisite
features are not clear. The medial surface is slightly concave
proximally, and relatively featureless. Between the proximal and distal
portions, there is a small development of shaft-like thickening along
the midline of the scapular blade manifested as a triangular convexity.
The medial surface of the distal blade is smoother and slightly concave
proximodistally.

The scapula in *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* shows a great degree of
variation in its morphology, most likely due to its endochondral
development. The middle portion of the proximal margin of the scapula,
which would have been placed opposite the anterior notch of the coracoid
in life, is often roughened, but is rounded and smoothed in NHMUK PV
R2140. The acromion process is clearly offset anteriorly in some
specimens, forming a strong emargination of the dorsal margin (e.g. 
NHMUK PV R1667 and PETMG R222). The dorsal margin is also occasionally
straighter and confluent with the acromion process, which is more square
proximally (e.g.  NHMUK PV R2133). @Maxwell2011b [p. 460] claim that the
"morphological variation exhibited in the scapula of *Ophthalmosaurus
icenicus* alone approaches the total amount of variation seen in the
element among ophthalmosaurids as a whole". The similarity between the
pectoral girdles of different ophthamosaurids makes it of little use
taxonomically. Whether the extensive variation in *Ophthalmosaurus
icenicus* is peculiar to this species, or a result of the relative glut
of material is unclear. Great variation is also found in the pectoral
girdles and forelimbs of other common ichthyosaurs, especially
*Ichthyosaurus* and *Stenopterygius*
[@McGowan1974a; @McGowan1979; @Johnson1979].

The forelimb is robust and strongly modified to a hydrodynamical shape
([@McGowan1973a; @McGowan1992b];
[\[fig:Oicenicus-flimbdor,pl22\]](#fig:Oicenicus-flimbdor,pl22){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-flimbdor,pl22"}). Disarticulation of much of
the material from the Oxford Clay Formation has led to differing
interpretations of the orientation and articulation of the forelimb
elements. Efforts to solve this have focussed on the humerus, which has
the most distinct characteristics and asymmetries. The articulations and
orientations of the more distal elements follow from the interpretation
of the humerus. @Seeley1874 [p. 705, pl. 46, fig. 3] originally showed
the humerus and forelimb inverted anteroposteriorly (compared to the
orientation used in the following sections), so that the smallest facet
was located posteriorly, equivalent to the right and left humeri being
switched. @Andrews1910 [pp 51--53, fig. 36], apparently on the advice of
Mr Alfred Leeds, reversed this orientation dorsoventrally, placing the
dorsal process ventrally: the forelimb was placed on the correct side,
but rotated 180° on its long axis. The orientation of the humerus was
corrected by @Kirton1983 [p. 96], following the interpretation of
articulated specimens of *Stenopterygius* by @Johnson1979. Therefore,
both @Seeley1874 [pl. 46, fig. 3] and @Andrews1910 [fig. 36a, b] figured
a left humerus (the paratype: NHMUK PV R2134) in dorsal view. Because of
these re-orientations of the forelimb, the names given to more distal
elements, particularly the epipodials and proximal carpals, have
changed. Also, the configuration and homologies of the ichthyosaur
forelimb have caused problems for several authors, particularly when the
material studied is disarticulated
[@Kiprijanoff1881; @McGowan1972a; @Johnson1979]. Here, we follow the
nomenclature of @Motani1999 [see especially fig. 7 A], which follows
Kirton ([@Kirton1983];
[\[fig:Oicenicus-flimbdor\]](#fig:Oicenicus-flimbdor){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-flimbdor"}). For *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*,
confident reconstruction of the forelimb is largely based on a sketch
made by Mr Alfred Leeds and kept in the NHMUK collections with specimen
NHMUK PV R3702 [@Kirton1983 fig. 29]. His knowledge, as one of the major
collectors of material, generates more certainty in positioning these
forelimb elements. In this interpretation, the forelimb of
*Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* possesses four primary digits and two
accessory digits (see

The short and robust humerus is an important element in the pectoral
region of *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* and ichthyosaurs generally
([\[fig:Oicenicus-humdor,fig:Oicenicus-humven,fig:Oicenicus-humprox,fig:Oicenicus-humdist,fig:Oicenicus-humant,fig:Oicenicus-humpos,fig:Oicenicus-humerusoutlines,pl22,pl23\]](#fig:Oicenicus-humdor,fig:Oicenicus-humven,fig:Oicenicus-humprox,fig:Oicenicus-humdist,fig:Oicenicus-humant,fig:Oicenicus-humpos,fig:Oicenicus-humerusoutlines,pl22,pl23){reference-type="ref"

Proximally, the head is expanded to form a large surface for
articulation with the glenoid facets of the coracoid and scapula.
Distally, the humerus is expanded, particularly anteroposteriorly, and
separated into three facets for articulation with the radius, ulna and
an anterior accessory element. Between these extremities, the humerus is
constricted slightly into a short shaft-like diaphysis, marked by
anterior and posterior emarginations. The proximal surface is flattened
but slightly convex and heavily pitted throughout in both small and even
the largest individuals that show strong ossification in other elements,
indicating that the epiphysis was covered by a large amount of cartilage
(see
[\[OicenicusCoracoid,OicenicusScapula\]](#OicenicusCoracoid,OicenicusScapula){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusCoracoid,OicenicusScapula"}). Some humeri referable
to *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* have a low marginal ridge around the
proximal surface, creating a small internal channel. This is likely due
to variation in the extent of ossification of the cartilaginous cap. In
proximal view, the long axis of the proximal humerus is angled around
45° anteroventrally relative to the true anteroposterior orientation of
the humerus (as given by the distal facets). Although superficially
there appears to be torsion in the humeral shaft, this relates to the
lateral expansion of the proximal head by the large dorsal and ventral
trochanters [@Kirton1983]. The dorsal process is situated about halfway
along on the anteroposterior length of the humerus, and rises into a
high, plate-like ridge. Proximally, the surface is pitted, a
continuation of the proximal cartilaginous cap, but much of the distal
surface is finished, although roughened for the attachment of the
pectoral muscles. Distally, the dorsal process descends into the humeral
diaphysis, extending slightly anteriorly along its length, for about
half of the proximodistal length of the humerus. The larger ventral
process is not as sharply demarcated from the main body of the humerus,
and is positioned further anteriorly than the dorsal process, towards
the anterior margin. It is analogous to the deltopectoral crest
[@Kirton1983; *contra* @Johnson1979]. The ventral process is a broad,
rounded projection of the anteroventral portion of the humerus,
extending the proximal surface of the humerus, and causing the apparent
torsion described above. Much of the more distal surface is finished,
but roughened for the attachment of muscle slips, however, in the
paratype (NHMUK PV R2134), several unfinished pits descend onto the
ventral surface from the proximal surface. This likely reflects
variation in proximal ossification. The ventral process also extends
over the diaphysis of the humerus for more than half of its length. This
causes a broad proximal anterior surface on the humerus, made slightly
concave due to the strong anterior development of the dorsal process,
which narrows distally. The anterior margin of the humerus is broad and
rounded, compared to the narrower and sharper posterior margin; these
features help in orientating isolated humeri [@Kirton1983]. These two
margins converge distally from the proximal head, forming the diaphysis,
before rapidly diverging to form the long distal articular portion of
the humerus. @Kirton1983 [94] noted that the posterior margin does not
appear as strongly emarginated as the anterior margin. This is due in
part to the greater anterior expansion of the anterior margin distally
to accommodate the anterior distal facet.

Distally, the humerus is anteroposteriorly elongate, and slightly
broadened, for the distal articulations with the three epipodials. The
bone here is smoother than on the more proximal surfaces as there are no
muscle attachment points in this region. In dorsal or ventral view, the
distal margin of the humerus is separated into three parts by large
obtuse angles. These mark the positions of the ridges that separate the
three distal articular facets on the distal face of the humerus. The
facets are broad, concave and heavily pitted for the application of
cartilage that intervened between the articulations. The anterior facet
is the smallest; it is angled slightly anteriorly and articulates with
the anterior accessory element. This facet narrows anteriorly towards
the anterior margin of the humerus creating a triangular facet. The
middle facet faces distally, is the largest facet and is a rectangular
articulation for the radius. Towards the anteroposterior midline of this
facet, the distal face of the humerus broadens dorsoventrally. Posterior
to the radial facet, the posterior facet articulates with the ulna and
is deflected slightly posteriorly. This facet has a broad pentagonal
shape: the anterior portion is rectangular, but posterior to this,
tapers with the posterior margin of the humerus, becoming rounded
posteriorly. The irregular form of the ulnar facet is extended by the
development of two tubera on the distal margin of the humerus dorsally
and ventrally, at about the anteroposterior midline of that facet. These
tubera are variably developed (compare NHMUK PV R2134 and R2173) and, in
some cases, extend distally onto the ulna, but usually the ventral tuber
is the largest (see
[\[OicenicusForelimbEpipodials\]](#OicenicusForelimbEpipodials){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusForelimbEpipodials"}; [@Kirton1983]). @Andrews1910
[53] suggested that this variability might be sexually dimorphic, citing
the approximately equal proportions of those specimens with and without
these tubera. However, the humerus is invariably broadened here, whether
the tubera are well developed or not. These prominences can also be
variably developed between both humeri of a single individual (e.g. 
NHMUK PV R2138); it is more likely that their relative development is a
result of individual variation rather than sexual dimorphism.

The humerus in *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* shows a certain amount of
variation, largely related to the extent of cartilage proximally and
distally, and to its position as the largest part of the forelimb
([\[fig:Oicenicus-humerusoutlines,tbl:Oicenicus-humeral-measurements\]](#fig:Oicenicus-humerusoutlines,tbl:Oicenicus-humeral-measurements){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-humerusoutlines,tbl:Oicenicus-humeral-measurements"}).
The dorsal and ventral processes vary in size, although the latter is
always larger, and thus the proximal dorsoventral expansion of the
humerus corresponds to the development of these processes. Perhaps the
most obvious instance of variation is found in the distal articular
facets, which vary greatly in relative size (particularly the anterior
accessory element facet) and orientation
([\[tbl:Oicenicus-humfacet-measurements\]](#tbl:Oicenicus-humfacet-measurements){reference-type="ref"
reference="tbl:Oicenicus-humfacet-measurements"}). @Fischer2012 [table
2] considered the ratio anterior facet length/radial facet length to be
of taxonomic importance in ophthalmosaurine ichthyosaurs. However, the
values obtained for *Acamptonectes densus* fall into the range of
variation exhibited by specimens referred to *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*
(0.173--0.778;
[\[tbl:Oicenicus-humfacet-measurements\]](#tbl:Oicenicus-humfacet-measurements){reference-type="ref"
reference="tbl:Oicenicus-humfacet-measurements"}), although the median
value is slightly higher (0.414) in *Ophthalmosaurus*. Alongside
variation in the distal facets, the constriction of the humeral
diaphysis, which is generally strong in *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*,
varies in breadth. This creates a stronger separation of the proximal
and distal heads in NHMUK PV R1668 than in R2853, for instance.

The humerus of *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* was originally considered to
be diagnostic of the genus [@Seeley1874]. Later discoveries of Middle
and Late Jurassic ophthalmosaurid ichthyosaurs, such as *Arthropterygius
chrisorum, Caypullisaurus bonapartei,* and *Undorosaurus gorodischensis*
have reduced its taxonomic utility somewhat. In all ichthyosaurs, the
humerus is one of the most useful aids in taxonomic identification,
along with the configuration of the rest of the forelimb [@Motani1999].
Within Ophthalmosauridae, the distal articulations of the humerus become
more variable also: the relative positions of the distal elements
ostensibly become more plastic between taxa. The orientation of the
facets, particularly the ulnar facet, which may face distally or
slightly posteriorly, has also been used in systematic studies
[@Fischer2013a character 34]. Some phylogenetic analyses have identified
the development of the dorsal and ventral processes as important in the
systematics of Parvipelvia [@Fischer2012; @Fischer2013a]. The dorsal
process becomes notably well developed and plate-like [@Motani1999c
character 56] in the more derived parvipelvians. Similarly, the ventral
process is very poorly developed [@Fischer2013a character 39] in
*Leptonectes* and *Temnodontosaurus* [@McGowan1974; @McGowan1974a], but
larger in more derived taxa, such as *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus,
Brachypterygius extremus,* and other ophthalmosaurids (see above &

[\[OicenicusForelimbEpipodials\]]{#OicenicusForelimbEpipodials
label="OicenicusForelimbEpipodials"}

The radius and ulna articulate with the middle and posterior distal
facets of the humerus respectively
([\[fig:Oicenicus-forelimb,pl22\]](#fig:Oicenicus-forelimb,pl22){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-forelimb,pl22"}). The humerus also articulates
with a pre-axial accessory element; this will be considered in
[\[OicenicusForelimbAccessory\]](#OicenicusForelimbAccessory){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusForelimbAccessory"}. Following the re-orientation of
the forelimb by Kirton ([-@Kirton1983]; see
[\[OicenicusHumerus\]](#OicenicusHumerus){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusHumerus"}), note that the names of these elements
are reversed from those published prior to this (as in
[@Seeley1874; @Andrews1910]).

Both the radius and ulna are short, strongly thickened, polygonal
elements. The radius is smaller than the ulna and subpentagonal. It
articulates with (right forelimb, clockwise from proximal in dorsal
view) the humerus, pre-axial accessory element, radiale, intermedium,
and ulna. For these articulations, the radius has a flattened proximal
face and is pointed distally, taking the space between the proximal
margins of the radiale and intermedium. The dorsal and ventral surfaces
are finished, but slightly roughened, whereas the edges and the vertical
faces, which articulate with the surrounding elements, are heavily
pitted where thick cartilage would have intervened. Proximally, the
radius follows the contours of its humeral articulation, and so becomes
slightly thicker towards the centre of this surface. Andrews'
[-@Andrews1910 p. 54, fig. 37] description shows the radius and ulna
separated by an interosseous space. The size of the contacts between the
radius, ulna and other elements are variable. In some specimens, the
radius can be square from a lack of close contact, as in NHMUK PV R2853
and GLAHM V1893.

The anterior portion of the ulna is thickened, like the radius, but
posteriorly it becomes narrower, along with the posterodistal humerus,
tapering towards the posterior margin of the forelimb. This element is
more square than the radius, articulating with (right forelimb,
clockwise from proximal in dorsal view) the humerus, radius,
intermedium, ulnare, and sometimes the proximalmost post-axial accessory
element [= pisiform of @Johnson1979]. The medial, proximal, and distal
articular faces are large, and heavily pitted for the application of
cartilage, as is the case with the radius. However, the facet for the
post-axial accessory element is small and poorly developed, and, when in
articulation, these two elements are not positioned as close together as
the other surrounding bones. On the proximal, dorsal, and ventral
margins, there may be a large tubercle, placed close to the
corresponding tubercle on the humerus (see
[\[OicenicusHumerus\]](#OicenicusHumerus){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusHumerus"}; [@Kirton1983]). Posteriorly, the ulna
becomes thinner, and the dorsal and ventral surfaces are slightly
concave, reflecting this. The posterior margin, unlike all others on the
ulna, is not pitted, but is comparatively smooth, although still
roughened. This narrowing is only found in *Ophthalmosaurus*
[@Andrews1910; @Fischer2013a]. @Seeley1874 [p. 705] noted the nutritive
foramina close to the articular margins on all bones of the forelimb.

[\[OicenicusCarpals\]]{#OicenicusCarpals label="OicenicusCarpals"}

In *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*, there are three proximal carpals:
radiale, intermedium, and ulnare, and three distal carpals, supporting
digits two, three, and four of the pentadactyl manus
([\[fig:Oicenicus-forelimb,pl22\]](#fig:Oicenicus-forelimb,pl22){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-forelimb,pl22"}). Proximal carpal five and the
entire first digit have been lost [@Motani1999]. The proximal carpals
are of similar size and shape: the radiale and intermedium are clearly
polygonal, with several facets for articulation with the surrounding
elements. The radiale articulates with (right forelimb, clockwise from
proximal in dorsal view) the proximal pre-axial accessory element,
second pre-axial accessory element, distal carpals two and three,
intermedium, and radius, while the intermedium articulates with the
radius, radiale, distal carpals three and four, ulnare, and ulna. Like
the radius proximally, these are strongly thickened elements, with
roughened dorsal and ventral surfaces and heavily pitted vertical
articular faces where cartilage was present. The intermedium is wedged
between the radius and ulna proximally, and distal carpals three and
four distally, so that both its proximal and distal margins are pointed.
The ulnare has more rounded margins than the two more anterior proximal
carpals and, like the ulna, narrows towards the posterior margin of the
forelimb. This bone articulates with the ulna, intermedium, distal
carpal four, metacarpal five, and the proximal post-axial accessory
element [= pisiform of @Johnson1979]. @Kirton1983 [p. 101] noted that,
when articulated, the proximal and distal borders of the radiale,
intermedium and ulnare align obliquely to the long axis of the forelimb.
This is continued by more distal elements, but is less clear as these
are rounded. @Johnson1979 [pp 75--76] suggested that this allowed
flexibility without creating lines of weakness in the forelimb.

The three distal carpals (two, three, and four) represent smaller forms
of the proximal carpals and are very similar in shape. Distal carpals
three and four particularly are placed closely between the proximal
carpals (radiale and intermedium, and intermedium and ulnare
respectively) and so have pointed proximal margins. In all three
elements, the distal margins are more rounded than in the more proximal
limb elements. This reflects the transition to the more distal
metacarpals and phalanges, which are all rounded, and were individually
surrounded by thick cartilage [@Kirton1983]. Both the proximal and
distal carpals are thinner than the epipodials, but still have broad
vertical faces for articulation with surrounding elements, particularly
on the closely applied proximal margins.

[\[OicenicusMetacarpals\]]{#OicenicusMetacarpals
label="OicenicusMetacarpals"}

Following @Motani1999, the four metacarpals present in *Ophthalmosaurus
icenicus* represent the homologues of metacarpals two to five in the
pentadactyl manus
([\[fig:Oicenicus-forelimb,pl22\]](#fig:Oicenicus-forelimb,pl22){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-forelimb,pl22"}). This differs from Kirton's
[-@Kirton1983] interpretation, in which metacarpals one to four are
present, and also in their position, due to the lack of a fourth distal
carpal (see
[\[OicenicusCarpals\]](#OicenicusCarpals){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusCarpals"}). The metacarpals are more rounded and
irregularly shaped than the more proximal elements in dorsoventral view,
approaching the form of the phalanges. However, they retain obliquely
angled margins, particularly proximally, for articulation with the
distal carpals. Their shape and position suggest that they have lost
close contact with adjacent elements. Many of the more distal limb
elements would have been surrounded by cartilage, and the variable
ossification of this creates heterogeneity in the forms of these
elements. Each metacarpal supports a single digit distally (see
[\[OicenicusForelimbDigits\]](#OicenicusForelimbDigits){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusForelimbDigits"}). From the metacarpals, the digits
are directed slightly anteriorly due to the zigzag orientation of the
distal faces of the distal carpals and metacarpals. As stated above,
this may aid in reducing lines of weakness in the forelimb. Metacarpals
two to four are more discoidal than the proximal elements. Their
vertical faces retain the roughness and pitting associated with the
cartilage surrounding each element.

The loss of the fifth distal carpal and reduction of distal carpals two,
three, and four (see
[\[OicenicusCarpals\]](#OicenicusCarpals){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusCarpals"}) means that the fifth metacarpal is
positioned more proximally than the line of the other three metacarpals,
articulating proximally with the ulnare. In this position, it aligns
with the distal carpal row, effectively replacing distal carpal five,
and has taken on a sub-quadrate form, similar to the other distal
carpals. Metacarpal five is noticeably larger and more equidimensional
in dorsal and ventral view than the other three metacarpals and has a
closer contact with the ulnare and distal carpal four proximally and
anteroproximally respectively. It is also slightly thicker than the
other metacarpals, due to its more proximal position. The posterior
margin is notably convex, and would articulate with the post-axial
accessory digit, although this contact would probably not have been
close.

[\[OicenicusForelimbDigits\]]{#OicenicusForelimbDigits
label="OicenicusForelimbDigits"}

The forelimb in *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* possesses four primary
digits, homologues of digits two to five of the pentadactyl manus,
supported proximally by metacarpals two to five ([@McGowan1972b];
[\[fig:Oicenicus-forelimb,pl22\]](#fig:Oicenicus-forelimb,pl22){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-forelimb,pl22"}). From Leeds' diagram (see
[\[OicenicusForelimb\]](#OicenicusForelimb){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusForelimb"}), the proximal digital elements appear to
be angled slightly anteriorly, curving distally to line up approximately
with the long axis of the forelimb. At least seven phalanges were
present in each digit, and eight in digit 4, but @Kirton1983 suggested
that this is unlikely to be the full complement. The phalanges are
rounded in dorsal and ventral view and decrease in size and thickness
distally; the proximal phalanges are more elliptical and elongate
anteroposteriorly than the distal elements. Like in more proximal
elements, the margins of the primary digits are roughened and pitted and
have a central groove along this face, creating a slight hourglass shape
in anterior or posterior view. The phalanges remain rather
dorsoventrally thick proximally, but narrow greatly in the distal
forelimb, becoming more discoidal. This, and their relative spacing,
indicates that a significant amount of cartilage was present between the
individually ossified elements, particularly distally. As forelimb
material is often disarticulated, variation in its configuration, common
in Lower Jurassic taxa, is difficult to determine. Some reconstructions
have been attempted, which show the possibility of digital bifurcation
(e.g.  NHMUK PV R2853, right forelimb; [@Andrews1910; @Kirton1983]), but
this is circumstantial.

[\[OicenicusForelimbAccessory\]]{#OicenicusForelimbAccessory
label="OicenicusForelimbAccessory"}

Two complete (extending a similar length to the primary digits)
accessory digits are present in the forelimb of *Ophthalmosaurus
icenicus*: an anterior accessory digit, of which the proximal element
articulates with the anterior distal facet of the humerus, and a
posterior accessory digit, of which the proximal element articulates
proximally with a proximodistal facet on the ulna
([\[fig:Oicenicus-forelimb,pl22\]](#fig:Oicenicus-forelimb,pl22){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-forelimb,pl22"}). @Kirton1983 [fig. 30] further
identified an isolated element in NHMUK PV R3702 that may be part of an
incomplete second post-axial accessory digit. The proximal pre-axial
accessory element -- "olecranon" of @Seeley1874 [p. 703, pl. 46,
fig. 3], "pisiform" of @Andrews1910 [pp 53, 54, fig. 37, pl. 2, fig. 4],
and "extra zeugopodial element" of @Motani1999 [p. 39, fig. 7] --
articulates proximally with the anterior distal facet of the humerus and
with the radius, radiale and distal pre-axial accessory digit
(anticlockwise from proximal in dorsal view). This element is triangular
in dorsoventral cross section along the anteroposterior axis,
corresponding to the shape of the distal humeral facet, and slightly
rounded in dorsal and ventral views, becoming a little wider distally.
The anterior narrowing of this element helps form a streamlined
forelimb, as seen in many ichthyosaurs [@McGowan1992b]. Its other
articular faces are thickened greatly, the posterior facet almost
matching the thickness of the radius, and are heavily pitted for the
application of cartilage between these articulations. The more distal
elements of the pre-axial accessory digit match the corresponding rows
along which they align, becoming thinner and more rounded distally. The
decrease in size of the pre-axial accessory digit elements occurs more
rapidly distally and there is often no more than six elements distal to
the humerus. These narrow to form a streamlined anterior margin to the
forelimb. Like more posterior elements, the contacts are not necessarily
close, particularly distally, so that only the proximal two elements
have an angled posterior margin.

The proximalmost element of the post-axial accessory digit is usually
homologised with the pisiform. This element articulates proximally with
a small facet on the posterodistal ulna and with the posterior ulna. In
dorsoventral view, the pisiform is teardrop-shaped, tapering proximally,
and also narrows towards the posterior margin of the forelimb, as with
the corresponding pre-axial element. The post-axial element immediately
distal to the pisiform is also proximodistally elongate, but the
elements distal to this are more rounded. As with the pre-axial digit,
these elements are smaller than those in the rows they align with,
although this digit may have eight elements.

The pelvic girdle is very much reduced in comparison with the pectoral
girdle, and has lost all bony contact with the vertebral column
([1.27](#fig:Oicenicus-pelvis-hlimb){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-pelvis-hlimb"}). It comprises only two
elements, a slender ilium and a fused, plate-like ischiopubis.
Reconstructions of the position and articulations of the pelvic girdle
are based upon mostly complete and articulated specimens of
*Stenopterygius* from the Toarcian of south-western Germany (compare the
reconstructions of [@Wiman1921 figs 5 & 6,] with [@Huene1922]). As
mentioned above (see
[\[OicenicusVertebralcolumn\]](#OicenicusVertebralcolumn){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusVertebralcolumn"}), the lack of contact with the
axial skeleton means that the position of the pelvic girdle, and
associated sacral region, is uncertain. @Buchholtz2001 and @Kirton1983
placed this contact around vertebrae 39 and 42 respectively.

[\[OicenicusIlium\]]{#OicenicusIlium label="OicenicusIlium"}

The ilium is a short, curved and twisted rod of bone forming the dorsal
portion of the pelvic girdle
([\[fig:Oicenicus-pelvislat,fig:Oicenicus-pelvismed,pl24\]](#fig:Oicenicus-pelvislat,fig:Oicenicus-pelvismed,pl24){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-pelvislat,fig:Oicenicus-pelvismed,pl24"}, figs
1, 2). There is no direct connection to the vertebral column, but the
pelves were likely attached by ligaments that connected dorsally.
@Kirton1983 used this twisting to determine that the distal ilium is
deflected medially to lie alongside the vertebral column. This allows
the position of the pelvic girdle to be determined with reasonable
certainty (see also
[\[OicenicusVertebralcolumn\]](#OicenicusVertebralcolumn){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusVertebralcolumn"}). The proximal end is a broad
elliptical, pitted facet, capped by cartilage in life, that articulates
with the anteroproximal portion of the ischiopubis (see
[\[OicenicusIschiopubis\]](#OicenicusIschiopubis){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusIschiopubis"}). This facet is larger than the
corresponding facet on the ischiopubis, so that the posterior portion of
the ilium forms part of the acetabulum. @Andrews1910 and @Kirton1983
disagreed on the relative size of the acetabular contribution, the
former describing a larger face than the latter. This feature appears to
be variable between specimens (compare GLAHM V1070, V1916 and NHMUK PV
R2853), although the contribution of the ilium is always smaller than
that of the ischiopubis (see
[\[OicenicusIschiopubis\]](#OicenicusIschiopubis){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusIschiopubis"}). The lateral surface of the ilium in
some specimens (e.g.  GLAHM V1899) is striated and may mark the origin
of muscles that powered the hindlimb [@Kirton1983]. Distal to this, the
shaft of the ilium narrows along its length, flattening distally, and
curves medially, so that the distal end is angled at about 30° to the
vertical. The surface of this portion is smooth. Distally, the tip of
the ilium is angled further medially than the curve of the bone more
proximally. The medial surface is strongly rugose for the ligamentous
and cartilaginous attachment to the vertebral column.

The ischium and pubis are fused along most of their proximodistal
length, together forming an elongate plate
([\[fig:Oicenicus-pelvislat,fig:Oicenicus-pelvismed,pl24\]](#fig:Oicenicus-pelvislat,fig:Oicenicus-pelvismed,pl24){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-pelvislat,fig:Oicenicus-pelvismed,pl24"}, figs
3--8). Their close association makes it reasonable to consider them
together: no clear suture line is visible along their contact. The pubis
is reduced to an anterior bar at the anterior of the ischiopubis, with
the ischium forming much of the posterior, plate-like portion. This is
shown by the retention of a narrow, proximodistally elongate obturator
foramen close to the anterior edge of the ischiopubis ([@McGowan2003],
[after @Romer1956]). @Kirton1983 [104] did not consider this opening to
be homologous with the obturator foramen, but the evolutionary sequence
expounded by McGowan & Motani [-@McGowan2003 56] suggests that this may
be the case (see below). Proximally, the ischiopubis forms a broad,
triangular articular surface that narrows posteriorly, for the ilium
anteromedially and the acetabulum, which occupies most of this surface
laterally and posteriorly. The surface is heavily pitted for the
application of cartilage, and is convex; the acetabular portion faces
slightly posteriorly and laterally, and the ilial facet is angled
slightly ventrally. From this, the anterolateral face of the ischiopubis
(formed by the pubis) is broadened where it meets the proximal articular
surface, and slightly concave, becoming narrower and flatter distally.
Laterally, the pubis is raised dorsal to the posterolateral face of the
ischium, allowing identification of right and left contralateral
elements; the surface is even medially. Distal to the proximal
articulations, the ischiopubis narrows slightly, separating these facets
from the distal plate-like portion, largely formed by the ischium. The
ischium widens towards the distal margin, particularly as the thinner
posterior margin is directed posterodistally. Posterior to the pubic
portion of the ischiopubis, the obturator foramen forms the proximal
portion of a proximodistally elongate channel that extends distally to
the distal margin of the ischiopubis, marking the approximate line of
fusion between the pubis and ischium. Close to the distal margin, along
this line, one or two foramina are present in some specimens. These can
be entirely enclosed in the ischiopubis or open distally forming a small
notch in the distal margin of the ischiopubis. The occurrence, size, and
position of these are variable between and within specimens (compare
GLAHM V1070, V1916, and V1912). For instance, there are two foramina
distally in GLAHM V1912, positioned posterior to the anterior margin.
The distal margin of the ischiopubis is convex in lateral view,
particularly anteriorly, pitted, and has a groove along its length
indicating that it was extended by cartilage, with no direct contact
between the two ischiopubes [@Andrews1910].

The hindlimb is strongly reduced relative to the forelimb -- the femur
is about 0.6 times the length of the humerus -- and there are far fewer
elements in the hindlimb than in the forelimb
([\[fig:Oicenicus-hlimb,pl25\]](#fig:Oicenicus-hlimb,pl25){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-hlimb,pl25"}, fig. 6). Unlike the forelimb,
there are fewer specimens that have been recorded as articulated,
although several specimens are mounted as such. Neither did Mr Alfred
Leeds produce a sketch diagram as he did for the forelimb (see
[\[OicenicusForelimb\]](#OicenicusForelimb){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusForelimb"}). Because of this, the configuration of
the hindlimb as a whole has been uncertain. @Kirton1983 accepted the
reconstruction of @Andrews1907 [@Andrews1910], who had discussions with
Mr Alfred Leeds, although Kirton re-oriented the hindlimb. @Andrews1907
[p. 208, fig. 5] originally oriented the femur with the smaller facet
positioned anteriorly, and the smaller proximal process dorsally, later
reversing this anteroposteriorly [@Andrews1910 p. 58, fig. 41].
@Kirton1983 [p. 105], following a similar pattern to her re-orientation
of the humerus, reversed this dorsoventrally, so that the larger, more
anterior proximal process is the ventral. In their interpretation,
@McGowan2003 [p. 42, fig. 65] invoked further characters and
comparisons, such as the extent of the processes distally along the
femur, orienting the femur so that the anterior margin is narrow and the
ventral process is crest-like, thus accepting Andrews' [-@Andrews1910]
interpretation. @Maxwell2012c [p. 1209, fig. 1 P--T], used comparisons
with articulated *Mixosaurus, Ichthyosaurus,* and the then undescribed
*Cryopterygius kristiansenae*, to infer the orientation of the femur.
Their interpretation reversed those of @Andrews1910 and @McGowan2003
anteroposteriorly, and reversed that of Kirton's [-@Kirton1983]
dorsoventrally. Maxwell *et al.*'s [-@Maxwell2012c] orientation is
followed here: the femur is oriented with the broader, more
anteriorly-positioned process dorsally; the narrower process, adjacent
to the anterior concavity, is considered the ventral process; the tibial
facet is typically larger than the fibular facet. The anterior face of
the femur is broad, while the posterior margin is narrow and sharp,
similar to the humerus (see
[\[OicenicusHumerus\]](#OicenicusHumerus){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusHumerus"}).

[\[OicenicusFemur\]]{#OicenicusFemur label="OicenicusFemur"}

The femora take a similar form to the humeri, but differ in their
dimensions
([\[fig:Oicenicus-hlimb,pl25\]](#fig:Oicenicus-hlimb,pl25){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-hlimb,pl25"}, figs 1--5). Proximally, the
articular surface is broad and more strongly convex and rounded than the
proximal surface of the humerus. The surface is unfinished and heavily
pitted for application of the acetabular cartilage. In proximal view,
the extensive dorsal and ventral processes give this surface a
triangular form: the anterior edge aligns dorsoventrally and is
sinusoidal, convex dorsally and concave ventrally, following the
contours of the anterior face. Posterior to this, the proximal surface
narrows towards the posterior margin. The anterior face of the femur is
wide dorsoventrally, due to the great extent of the dorsal and ventral
processes, and is slightly concave. This makes the femur appear
relatively more massive than the humerus proximally. The dorsal and
ventral processes are angled slightly anteriorly at their greatest
height, making the anterior face slightly concave, particularly
proximally. Distally, the anterior face narrows as these processes
descend onto the diaphysis of the femur, giving it a spatulate
appearance. Further distally, the anterior face of the femur becomes
convex, reflecting the dorsal or ventral elongation of the distal femur.
The dorsal process of the femur is the larger of the two and positioned
anterodorsally, slightly anterior to the ventral process when viewed in
dorsoventral view. This process is large and triangular, creating a
slight convexity to the dorsal portion of the anterior margin.
Proximally, the surface is heavily pitted for application of the
articular cartilage. Distal to this, the dorsal process forms a
prominent ridge just behind the anterior margin of the femur that
descends distally onto the diaphysis for about half of the femoral
length. The surface of this ridge is usually roughened for the
attachment of muscles, but in some specimens (e.g.  NHMUK PV R10031),
the unfinished proximal surface extends distally. The ventral process of
the proximal femur is slightly smaller and shorter proximodistally than
the dorsal process. This process is narrower and more crest-like, being
offset from the proximal surface by broad concavities in the ventral
portion of the anterior face and the posteroventral face. The proximal
surface continues the pitting for the articular cartilage, but the
anterior and lateral faces are finished with cortical bone, although
roughened for muscle attachment. The ventral process descends rapidly
onto the femoral diaphysis for slightly less than half the length of the
femur. Behind these two processes, two broad faces are oriented
posterodorsally and posteroventrally respectively. These are slightly
concave, particularly in their proximal portions, and meet at the
narrow, sharp posterior margin of the femur, similar to the form in the
humerus. In dorsal and ventral view, the femur is constricted slightly
distally to one-half of its proximodistal length. This is caused by the
concave anterior and posterior margins. Distally, the margins diverge to
accommodate the distal portion and facets of the femur, with the
anterior margin angled further anteriorly than the posterior margin is
angled posteriorly.

Distally, the femur becomes elongate anteroposteriorly; the anterior
margin is well rounded and convex, while the posterior margin becomes
less sharply defined. @Kirton1983 [106--107] noted that the anterodistal
point of the femur is blunt and the surface unfinished, suggesting that
it may have been continued in cartilage. The distal surface has two
large facets that articulate with the epipodials. As with the humerus
(see [\[OicenicusHumerus\]](#OicenicusHumerus){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusHumerus"}), the two facets are oriented differently:
the posterior facet faces slightly posteriorly relative to the anterior,
forming a large obtuse angle between the two in dorsal and ventral view.
This point marks where a dorsoventral ridge separates the two facets on
the distal face. The two facets are sub-rectangular and concave,
narrowing slightly toward the anterior and posterior ends of the femur,
and are heavily pitted for the application of the intervening cartilage.
The anterior facet is slightly longer and larger than the posterior
facet, and articulates distally with the tibia (see
[\[OicenicusHindlimbEpipodials\]](#OicenicusHindlimbEpipodials){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusHindlimbEpipodials"}); the posterior facet is for
articulation with the fibula. There are slight protuberances on the
dorsal and ventral surfaces of the femur, just proximal to the fibular
facet, and confluent with a slight bulge on the fibula, similar to those
associated with the ulna on the humerus (see
[\[OicenicusHumerus\]](#OicenicusHumerus){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusHumerus"}). These are not developed to anywhere near
the same extent, and may be a result of the rapid narrowing of the
posterodistal femur.

[\[OicenicusHindlimbEpipodials\]]{#OicenicusHindlimbEpipodials
label="OicenicusHindlimbEpipodials"}

The hindlimb epipodials are similar in form to the forelimb epipodials,
articulating proximally with the femur, and forming thickened discs that
taper slightly towards the hindlimb margins, creating a hydrodynamical
shape
([\[fig:Oicenicus-hlimb,pl25\]](#fig:Oicenicus-hlimb,pl25){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-hlimb,pl25"}, fig. 6). The anterior element,
the tibia, is the largest and it articulates with (right hindlimb,
clockwise from proximal in dorsal view) the femur, distal carpal two,
astragalus, and fibula respectively. This element is angled and
polygonal for these articulations. The articular faces are pitted for
the application of cartilage that, as with the forelimb, would intervene
between each element. While the anterior face of the tibia is rather
large, there is no certain evidence for an anterior accessory element;
the extent to which the tibia may have been extended by cartilage is
uncertain. The fibula is smaller and has a more rounded, ovoid shape.
This element articulates with (right hindlimb, clockwise from proximal
in dorsal view) the femur, tibia, astragalus, and calcaneum. The
anterior margin is straight for articulation with the tibia. However,
posteriorly, the fibula becomes narrower and the posterior margin may be
rather sharp, like the ulna (see
[\[OicenicusForelimbEpipodials\]](#OicenicusForelimbEpipodials){reference-type="ref"
reference="OicenicusForelimbEpipodials"}), and is not pitted. Unlike the
ulna, the posterior margin of the fibula is convex and curved in dorsal
and ventral views. Towards its anteroposterior midpoint, the proximal
border of the fibula becomes slightly broader, matching the location of
low protuberances on the femur; these may be points of muscle or
ligamentous attachment as between the humerus and ulna (see ). The
articular faces of the fibula are, like the tibia, pitted for cartilage
or connective tissue.

[\[OicenicusHindlimbMetapodials\]]{#OicenicusHindlimbMetapodials
label="OicenicusHindlimbMetapodials"}

In the reduced hindlimb of *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*, there are only
about 10 elements certainly present distal to the epipodials; both
@Andrews1910 [fig. 41] and @Kirton1983 [fig. 33] reconstructed the
hindlimb with this many metapodial elements (based on NHMUK PV
R4693--R4695;
[\[fig:Oicenicus-hlimb,pl25\]](#fig:Oicenicus-hlimb,pl25){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Oicenicus-hlimb,pl25"}, fig. 6). Apparently no example of
the hindlimb of *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* is more complete than NHMUK
PV R4693--R4695, nor shows the configuration of these more distal
elements. @Kirton1983 [107--108] refrained from homologising these
elements; @Caldwell1997 homologised the proximal tarsal elements in
*Stenopterygius* with (anterior to posterior) the centrale, astragalus,
and calcaneum. The most basal ichthyosaurs, however, have lost or do not
ossify the anterior proximal tarsal (centrale), and through their
evolution, the second distal tarsal moves proximally to take its place
[@McGowan2003]. Here we treat the proximal metapodial row as containing
(anterior to posterior) the second distal tarsal, astragalus, and
calcaneum; these correspond to the tibiale, intermedium, and fibulare of
@Andrews1910. These three elements are irregularly rounded and slightly
thickened, with pitted articular faces, but the contact between them and
other elements would not have been close. The second distal tarsal and
astragalus are about the same size and slightly larger than the
calcaneum, but all three elements are smaller and thinner than the
epipodials; the calcaneum, like the fibula, becomes slightly narrower
towards the posterior margin. The six elements more distal to these are
arranged into three digits, with two, three, and two elements
respectively (anterior to posterior). These are also rounded, discoidal
elements that become smaller and thinner distally. They retain pitted
margins, and there would have been thick cartilage separating these
elements, forming the hydrodynamical contours of the hindlimb. Whether
this represents a complete hindlimb is uncertain.
