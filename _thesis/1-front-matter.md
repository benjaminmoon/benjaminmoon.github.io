## Abstract 

Ichthyosaurs were a long-lived clade of Mesozoic marine reptiles with an
excellent fossil record and a history of 200 years of study. However,
this historical baggage means that several aspects of ichthyosaur
palaeobiology are in need of revision.

The ichthyosaur material of the British Middle and Upper Jurassic is
reassessed and at least four taxa are found to be present:
*Ophthalmosaurus icenicus, Brachypterygius extremus, Nannopterygius
enthekiodon,* and a newly identified indeterminate ophthalmosaurid. The
available material is described and compared with a focus on the
Ophthalmosauridae. Additional remains from the early Middle Jurassic of
Scotland and the Kimmeridgian--Tithonian of England suggest that this
diversity may be an underestimate.

A new phylogenetic matrix is compiled with 289 characters from recent
phylogenetic analyses coded for 106 valid ichthyosaur species. Analysis
of this dataset used maximum parsimony and likelihood criteria, and
implied weighting of characters. Initial results were poorly resolved,
but improved by *a priori* and *a posteriori* removal of unstable taxa.
The topology follows previous hypotheses of ichthyosaur phylogeny, but
several genera are not monophyletic, or taxa have different affinities
to those found previously. Uncertainty in ichthyosaur phylogenetics
suggests a need for revision of the characters used.

Ichthyosaur morphology through the Mesozoic is investigated using the
above cladistic dataset alongside analysis of rates of change in
continuous morphological characters. Ichthyosaurs rapidly increase in
morphological diversity between the Early and Middle Triassic, retaining
this disparity through the Mesozoic. A significant shift in morphospace
occupation occurs between the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic bins with
the evolution of Parvipelvia and Neoichthyosauria. The Middle
Jurassic--Late Cretaceous bins show no significant difference in
morphospace occupation. Increases in evolutionary rates occur towards
the base of ichthyosaur phylogeny and on the stem towards Parvipelvia.
This Late Triassic shift has previously been interpreted as a
bottleneck.

## Acknowledgements

There are many people who I must thank for their help, discussion, and
criticisms during my Ph.D. study.

First, I must thank my supervisors: Michael Benton & Emily Rayfield for
taking me on and helping me muddle my way through such an engaging, even
if at times frustrating, project as this. Also, for the assistance of
Marcello Ruta for being an additional help with various methods
throughout, and Philip Anderson and Philip Donoghue for doing my
progress advisory interviews and suggesting many further projects and
aspirations; I shall try to justify and maintain my swan-like
attributes. Thanks also to Angela Kirton for graciously giving me her
thesis materials and allowing to pursue this work.

Much help and advice was given by the many other PhD students of the
2011--2012 G3 cohort, and later moving in the G47, then the Radsphere.
I'd like to pick out David Button and Joseph Keating for lengthy
discussions, hilarity, and extensive zoo tat; and Thomas Stubbs, Mark
Puttick, and Christopher Rogers, for amusing me over the last four
years. From G3, Sarah Kemp was the first that I met, followed shortly by
David Schlaphorst, Philip Usher, and Matthew Whipple; but there so many
more to add here.

For access to specimens, there is a long list: Isla Gladstone, Deborah
Hutchinson, and Roger Vaughan (BRSMG); Sarah Finney and Matt Riley
(CAMSM); Neil Clark, J. Keith Ingham, and Jayne Stewart (GLAHM); Mark
Evans (LEICT); Paul Barrett and Sandra Chapman (NHMUK); Andrew Longworth
(PETMG); Paul Jeffrey (OUMNH); Amal Kreisheh and Dennis Parsons (WESTM);
and Steve Etches. This research was supported by funding from the
University of Bristol Bob Savage Memorial Fund, Geological Society of
London Daniel Pidgeon Fund, Palaeontographical Society Research Grant,
and Systematics Association Systematics Research Fund.

I must also thank the wonderful TeX/LaTeX community for fostering a love of
typography that has flowered through the latter part of my PhD study. While the
requirements of thesis submission may not lend itself to awesome typography, I
have tried to get close. The body typeface [in the PDF] is *Warnock* by Robert
Slimbach; _Gill Sans Nova_ by George Ryan on the design of Eric Gill was used
for many headings; and code and data is set in _Consolas_ by Luc(as) de Groot.
[This website uses Source Serif, Sans, and Code by Paul D. Hunt and Frank
Grießhammer.]

Finally, but perhaps most importantly, I would like to hugely thank my
parents, Mandy and Christopher Moon, for their support in my Ph.D.
research, and allowing to continue through four fascinating, annoying,
aggravating, exciting, and otherwise fantabulous years of study, plus a
few before then. The trick worked: I stuck around long enough that these
chumps started paying me!

I declare that the work in this dissertation was carried out in
accordance with the requirements of the University's Regulations and
Code of Practice for Research Degree Programmes and that it has not been
submitted for any other academic award. Except where indicated by
specific reference in the text, the work is the candidate's own work.
Work done in collaboration with, or with the assistance of, others, is
indicated as such. Any views expressed in the dissertation are those of
the author.
