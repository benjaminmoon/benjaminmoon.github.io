title: Introduction
---

Ichthyosaur specimens are, relatively speaking, not uncommon in the
Middle and Upper Jurassic of the UK. Indeed, in some horizons they
may form the majority of large vertebrate remains found. Despite
this, these later ichthyosaurs have often been sidelined because of
the greater attention paid to the more spectacular Lias Group
fossils found so abundantly along the Dorset and Yorkshire coasts.
Continued and repeated transgressions through the Middle Jurassic
(Aalenian--Bathonian; Hallam 2001) covered much of southern England
with shallow but productive seas by the late Middle and early Late
Jurassic (Callovian--Kimmeridgian), which supported a complex food
web, with ichthyosaurs dominating the upper tiers (Bradshaw et al.
1992; Martill et al. 1994; Wilkinson et al. 2008). These seas are
represented by the two great clay formations (Oxford Clay and
Kimmeridge Clay formations) that dominate the later part of the
Jurassic in Britain, and extend to north-western Europe. The
frequency with which ichthyosaur fossils have been, and are still,
uncovered, and their occasional completeness, makes these formations
important sources of ichthyosaur remains; the relative scarcity of
adequate descriptions belies this richness and diversity of
specimens. The ages of these ichthyosaur-bearing formations, between
the comparatively well-known ichthyosaurs of the Lower Jurassic and
the Lower Cretaceous, makes this an important transitional episode
between the two groups. During this time, Ophthalmosauridae
originated and diversified, leading to the separation of the
subclades Ophthalmosaurinae and Platypterygiinae (Fischer et al.
2013). The palaeogeographical position of the British Isles, along a
seaway that joined the Tethyan and Boreal marine realms, makes this
an important junction between those two disparate ichthyosaur faunas
(Bradshaw et al. 1992).

The amount of material, particularly incomplete specimens, has
caused differences in opinions on the taxonomy of these ichthyosaurs
(e.g.  Lydekker 1888; Huene 1922; McGowan 1976). Middle and Upper
Jurassic ichthyosaurs suffer especially from the number of taxa
based upon single and short series of vertebral centra (Owen 1840;
Phillips 1871), which essentially do not change form between the
Lower Jurassic and Cretaceous. This monograph aims to resolve the
taxonomy and affinities of British Middle and Upper Jurassic
ichthyosaurs by reappraising and re-describing the available
material within a modern, systematic framework. It is based upon the
unpublished, although ubiquitous, Ph.D. thesis of Dr Angela Kirton
(1983), who has graciously passed on her text and illustrations.
However, all the material has been re-examined by BCM and full
descriptions written anew, which form the main part of this
monograph. With the most available material, *Ophthalmosaurus
icenicus* (Seeley, 1874) (Figure 1.1) is described first in detail
([\[Oicenicus\]](#Oicenicus){reference-type="ref"
reference="Oicenicus"}). *Brachypterygius extremus* (Boulenger,
1904) ([\[Bextremus\]](#Bextremus){reference-type="ref"
reference="Bextremus"}), *Nannopterygius enthekiodon* (Hulke, 1871)
([\[Nenthekiodon\]](#Nenthekiodon){reference-type="ref"
reference="Nenthekiodon"}), and *Macropterygius*
sp. ([1.5.1.6](#Macropterygiusspindet){reference-type="ref"
reference="Macropterygiusspindet"}) are also described more briefly
([1.5.1](#tax:taxavalida){reference-type="ref"
reference="tax:taxavalida"}), and these four species are compared to
other ichthyosaur taxa with a focus on recently identified
phylogenetic characters
([1.6](#OsteologicalComparisons){reference-type="ref"
reference="OsteologicalComparisons"}). Invalid British Middle and
Upper Jurassic taxa are listed with discussion
([1.5.2](#Taxainvalida){reference-type="ref"
reference="Taxainvalida"}). Brief discussion is made on the
variation and taxonomic relations of *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus*
([\[synonymyOphthalmosaurusBaptanodon,OicenicusKimmClay\]](#synonymyOphthalmosaurusBaptanodon,OicenicusKimmClay){reference-type="ref"
reference="synonymyOphthalmosaurusBaptanodon,OicenicusKimmClay"}),
and the palaeobiogeography of Middle and Upper Jurassic ichthyosaurs
([\[tax:palaeobiogeography\]](#tax:palaeobiogeography){reference-type="ref"
reference="tax:palaeobiogeography"}).
