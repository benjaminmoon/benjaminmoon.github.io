title: Introduction

Ichthyosaurs, members of the clade Ichthyosauriformes (Motani *et al.,*
2015), are perhaps the Mesozoic reptile clade that were most completely
adapted to a marine habitat. During the 160 Ma of existence of the
clade, from the earliest Triassic to the early Late Cretaceous
(248--*c.* 90 Ma), there evolved 107 taxa that are considered valid
([2](#chapter2){reference-type="ref" reference="chapter2"}; McGowan and
Motani 2003; Maisch 2010). The earliest ichthyosaurs show clear
features to an aquatic existence -- viviparity, elongate rostrum and
tail, and paddle-like limbs -- while showing evidence of their
terrestrial and amphibious ancestry (Motani *et al.* 2014, 2015). Through
the evolution of the clade, ichthyosaurs evolved a more highly
streamlined morphology, reduction of the hindlimbs, large orbit, and
crescentic caudal fluke that allowed them to be highly mobile predators,
and a common part of many marine ecosystems throughout the Mesozoic
(McGowan and Motani 2003; Motani 2005, 2009; Maisch 2008; Marek et al.
2015).

The earliest known ichthyosaur material is from the *Procolombites* and
*Subcolombites* ammonite biozones (Olenekian, Lower Triassic) of the
Chaohu area, Anhui Province, China. It includes the ichthyosaur taxa
*Chaohusaurus geishanensis* (Young & Dong, 1972), *Chaohusaurus
chaoxianensis* (Chen, 1985), and *Cartorhynchus lenticarpus* (Motani *et
al.*, 2015) (Motani *et al.* 2014, 2015), as well as the sauropterygian
*Majiashanosaurus discocoracoidis* (Jiang *et al.*, 2014), and other
indeterminate remains (Young and Dong 1972; Chen 1985; Jiang et al.
2014). However, the group spread and diversified rapidly, with several
further taxa -- e.g. *Grippia longirostris* (Wiman, 1929), *Gulosaurus
helmi* (Cuthbertson *et al.*, 2013*a*), and *Utatsusaurus hataii*
(Shikama *et al.*, 1978) -- known from the Olenekian of Spitsbergen,
Canada, and Japan respectively (Wiman 1929, 1933; Shikama *et al.* 1978;
Brinkman *et al.* 1992; Cuthbertson *et al.* 2013*a,b*; Motani et al.
2014).

Through the Triassic, ichthyosaurs increased in diversity and occupation
of niches (Massare 1987; Massare and Callaway 1990; Thorne *et al.* 2011;
Fröbisch *et al.* 2013), a trait that was echoed in many other marine
reptile groups in the Middle--Late Triassic (e.g. Massare 1987, 1988;
Diedrich 2009; Neenan *et al.* 2014). Several ichthyosaur clades -- such
as the Mixosauridae (Baur, 1887) and Shastasauria (Motani, 1999) --
developed highly divergent ecologies: small, circalittoral, with a
heterodont crushing dentition in mixosaurids, while shastasaurians were
large to huge, some edentulous, and inferred ram-feeders (Massare 1987;
Massare and Callaway 1990; Motani *et al.* 2013; Dick and Maxwell 2015).

Across the Triassic--Jurassic boundary, following the end-Triassic Mass
Extinction (ETE), there was an apparent loss in disparity and a single
clade -- the Parvipelvia -- accounts for all Jurassic and Cretaceous
ichthyosaur diversity (Maisch 2010; Thorne *et al.* 2011; Fischer et al.
2013, 2014*d*). Despite this, ichthyosaur diversity remained high, and
they are a common component of many Jurassic and Cretaceous deposits
worldwide (Maisch and Matzke 2000; Bardet *et al.* 2014; Fischer et al.
2014*a*). In the Early Jurassic, the clade Thunnosauria (Motani, 1999)
evolved, which included the most highly derived ichthyosaurs. These taxa
possessed a highly streamlined morphology that was adapted to a likely
open ocean, pelagic lifestyle (Motani 2005). The Early Jurassic
lagerstätten in the Lias Group of the south-western United Kingdom
(Hettangian--Pliensbachian), the Posidonia Shale Formation of
south-western Germany (Toarcian), and others, have produced many
thousands of ichthyosaur fossils and other clades between them (McGowan
1974*a,b*, 1979; e.g. Maisch and Matzke 2000), giving an
extraordinarily complete view on the marine ecosystem at these times and
localities. But there are few such insights into subsequent epochs.

Much of the Middle Jurassic has produced few diagnostic ichthyosaur
remains globally (Fernández 1994, 2007; Maxwell *et al.* 2012). This
paucity of fossils has hampered studies into the evolution of
post-Triassic ichthyosaurs. During this time, the clade
Ophthalmosauridae originated and diversified (Fernández 2007; Fischer et
al. 2012, 2013; Druckenmiller and Maxwell 2014), but it is not until the
early Callovian Oxford Clay Formation lagerstätte, and the numerous
remains of *Ophthalmosaurus icenicus* (Seeley, 1874) -- an already
highly derived ophthalmosaurid -- that diagnostic ichthyosaur remains
become more common (Andrews 1910, 1913; Kirton 1983). Both the Oxford
Clay and the Kimmeridgian--Tithonian Kimmeridge Clay formations of
north-western Europe have produced numerous ichthyosaur remains (Hulke
1871; Sauvage 1911; e.g. Huene 1922; Taylor and Benton 1986). While many
remains from these strata are isolated or fragmentary, more complete or
three-dimensionally preserved specimens are not uncommon (e.g. Andrews
1915; McGowan 1997; Martill 2014; Fischer 2015). Coeval faunas are known
from Argentina, Russia, Svalbard, and the USA (Gilmore 1905; Fernández
2007; Druckenmiller *et al.* 2012; Roberts *et al.* 2014; Zverkov et al.
2015), and further non-diagnostic remains have been found in Madagascar
and Antarctica (Whitham and Doyle 1989; Fernández 1997).

Ichthyosaur diversity in the Cretaceous was thought to have been
comparatively low, with only the single, cosmopolitan genus
*Platypterygius* (Huene, 1922) (McGowan 1972). However, recent
reappraisal of the extensive material available has found a hidden
diversity prior to the extinction of the Ichthyosauriformes, adding
*Acamptonectes* (Fischer *et al.*, 2012), *Malawania* (Fischer *et al.*,
2013), and *Sisteronia* (Fischer *et al.*, 2014*a*), among others
(Zammit 2012; Fischer *et al.* 2013, 2014*a*). This recent increase in
taxic diversity has not yet been studied in terms of the effect of
relative morphological diversity ([3](#chapter3){reference-type="ref"
reference="chapter3"}). However, evidence suggests that the ecology of
post-Triassic -- indeed post-Early--Middle Triassic -- ichthyosaurs was
greatly diminished by competition, or the loss of niches that were not
subsequently recolonised (Thorne *et al.* 2011; Dick and Maxwell 2015).
The cause of the extinction of ichthyosaurs in the Cenomanian--Turonian
remains contentious, but this lack of innovation, combined with
competition, and a major ocean anoxic event (OAE), probably played a
large part (Bardet 1992; Thorne *et al.* 2011; Dick and Maxwell 2015;
Fischer 2015).

Despite 200 years of study since the first scientific description of a
recognised ichthyosaur (Home 1814; Torrens 1995), ichthyosaur research
currently faces several active areas of study, and problems to overcome;
perhaps most pressingly:

1.  The definition of several ichthyosaur taxa suffers from historical
    baggage, both from their initial definitions, and subsequent
    emendations of these. Perhaps the best example of this is
    *Ichthyosaurus*, which contains several species, initially defined
    based on teeth characteristics, and more recently on phenetic and
    cladistic characters (De la Beche and Conybeare 1821; McGowan
    1974*b*; Motani 1999; Maisch and Matzke 2000; Sander 2000).
    Reappraisal of such taxa in a modern taxonomic context is necessary.

2.  This couples with cladistic analyses that have, to date, only been
    applied to ichthyosaurs at the generic level, or to subsets of
    ichthyosaur taxa -- e.g. Mixosauridae, Thunnosauria, and
    Ophthalmosauridae (Motani 1999; Maisch and Matzke 2000; Sander 2000;
    Fischer *et al.* 2013, 2014*b*). Many taxa have been allied simply by
    association, such as *Nannopterygius enthekiodon* (Hulke, 1871),
    included within Ophthalmosauridae as it is from the Upper Jurassic
    (Motani 1999). This problem applies equally to characters within
    phylogenetic analyses as well as taxa; a complete integration of
    ichthyosaur phylogenetics is needed.

3.  The lack of a complete phylogenetic framework has limited the study
    of large-scale trends across ichthyosaur evolution, particularly
    quantitatively. Qualitative studies have analysed overall trends in
    ichthyosaur body morphology (McGowan and Motani 2003; Motani 2005),
    and recently, numerical methods have been applied to explore the
    diversification of ichthyosaur taxa, morphology, and ecology (Thorne
    *et al.* 2011; Fischer *et al.* 2013; Dick and Maxwell 2015). However,
    these studies have used incomplete datasets, often limited to
    generic level, that do not necessarily capture the full range of
    ichthyosaur diversity and disparity through the Mesozoic.

The aims of this thesis are to approach these problems in
ichthyosaurology, for which there are three questions to be addressed:

1. how many ichthyosaur taxa are present in the British Middle and Upper
   Jurassic? how may they be
   diagnosed? ([Chapter 1](/thesis/X-Ch1-1Introduction/))

2. how are all ichthyosaurs interrelated? are these relationships
   robust? ([2](#chapter2){reference-type="ref" reference="chapter2"})

3. what morphological trends do ichthyosaurs exhibit across their evolution?
   how does this relate to coeval
   occurrences? ([3](#chapter3){reference-type="ref" reference="chapter3"}).

Ichthyosaurs of the British Middle and Upper Jurassic form an important
transitional group between the well known European Lower Jurassic
taxa -- particularly from the Lias Group of southern England, and the
Posidonia Shale Formation of south-western Germany (McGowan 1974*a,b*,
1979; Maisch *et al.* 2008) -- and the common and diverse Cretaceous
ichthyosaurs (McGowan 1972; Fischer *et al.* 2012, 2013; 2014*a,c*).
These epochs encompass the origin and diversification of the clade
Ophthalmosauridae, which includes almost all post-Early Jurassic
ichthyosaur taxa (Fischer *et al.* 2013), a major portion of total
ichthyosaur diversity
([\[chapter2,chapter3\]](#chapter2,chapter3){reference-type="ref"
reference="chapter2,chapter3"}). In this thesis, the taxa present in the
British Middle and Upper Jurassic are diagnosed and re-described
completely based on historical and more recently available material,
with discussion on their relation to coeval faunas. *Ophthalmosaurus
icenicus* is the most common represented, and perhaps well known,
post-Lower Jurassic ichthyosaur, with numerous remains from the
Callovian Peterborough Member of the Oxford Clay Formation (Andrews
1910; Appleby 1956, 1958; Martill 1991). However, other taxa,
particularly *Brachypterygius extremus* (Boulenger, 1904) and
*Nannopterygius enthekiodon* from the Kimmeridgian--Tithonian Kimmeridge
Clay Formation, provide an important link between Ophthalmosauridae and
more basal Thunnosauria; e.g. *Brachypterygius extremus* has been
interpreted as one of the earliest members of the clade Platypterygiinae
(Fischer *et al.* 2013). Therefore, the taxonomy and osteology of these
ichthyosaurs are integral to understanding a major shift in ichthyosaur
evolution between the Early Jurassic and Cretaceous.

This new taxonomic data is then integrated into a large study of
ichthyosaur interrelationships using a combined supermatrix and modern
phylogeny analysis technique. This represents the first attempt to
include all ichthyosaur taxa, coded at the species level, in a single
analysis, and unites several previous character sets: the data matrix
contains over 30 000 data points ([2](#chapter2){reference-type="ref"
reference="chapter2"}). With this approach, the aim is to resolve the
positions of ichthyosaur taxa, but also identify the areas of
ichthyosaur phylogeny where there is uncertainty, and potential causes
of this. A complete phylogeny is necessary to explore the evolution of
the whole clade ([3](#chapter3){reference-type="ref"
reference="chapter3"}), which is studied using both cladistic
morphometric methods, and compared with similar analyses that have used
different datasets or characters (e.g. Thorne *et al.* 2011; Dick and
Maxwell 2015). Continuous traits of ichthyosaurs are included in a
comparative phylogenetic framework to analyse the rates at which this
group evolved through the Mesozoic.

These results will provide important taxonomic and systematic raw data
that can be included in and compared with further studies. It will also
provide a framework for further large scale studies of both ichthyosaur
evolution, how this relates to and integrates with other Mesozoic marine
reptile clades (e.g. Sauropterygia, Mosasauridae), and the evolution of
and influences on past marine ecosystems.
