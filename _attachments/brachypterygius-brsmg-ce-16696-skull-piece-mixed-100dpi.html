excerpt: Brachypterygius sp., skull piece and interpretation, from the Bristol Museum
  (undescribed & unfigured specimen Ce 16696). This is the treat I spoke of in a previous
  post. [Thanks to Paul for commenting on the labelling â€” what I had labelled as the
  angulars are more likely splenials.]
