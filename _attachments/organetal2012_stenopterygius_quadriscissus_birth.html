excerpt: 'Figure 7. A famous Stenopterygius specimen. This is usually interpreted
  as an adult with a juvenile in the process of being birthed: ichthyosaurs gave birth
  to live young, as with modern mammals. It is this, among other things, that likely
  allowed them to become so highly adapted to their marine lifestye. (From Organ et
  al. 2009.)'
