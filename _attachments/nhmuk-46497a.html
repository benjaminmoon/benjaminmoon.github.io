excerpt: 'Isolated hindpaddle of Nannopterygius enthekiodon, from the Kimmeridgian,
  in most views as suggested on SV-POW. There has been some slight dorsoventral crushing,
  hence the significant difference in size of the proximal femoral processes. Abbreviations:
  car: carpal, dp: dorsal process, fem: femur, fib: fibula, int: intermedium, tbl
  tibiale, tib: tibia, vp: ventral process.'
