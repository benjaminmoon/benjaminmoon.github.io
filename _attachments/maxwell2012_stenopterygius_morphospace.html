excerpt: 'Figure 1. Morphospace plot of Stenopterygius from the Posidonienschiefer.
  This shows the distributions of three species: S. quadriscissus, S. triscissus and
  S. uniter. Component 1 is related to size and growth. The starred specimens are
  embryos (to the left) and their mothers (to the right). Circled points are type
  specimens. (From Maxwell 2012a.)'
