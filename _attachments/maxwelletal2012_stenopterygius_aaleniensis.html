excerpt: Figure 2. Stenopterygius aaleniensis from the Aalenian of southwestern Germany.
  this shows the unusual preservation where the body is largely seen side-on, but
  the head and shoulders are face-on. A is the type specimen and B an interpretative
  drawing. (From Maxwell, Fern√°ndez and Schoch 2012.)
