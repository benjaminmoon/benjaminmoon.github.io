excerpt: Stenopterygius from the Lower Jurassic of southern Germany.  This is very
  commonly found in quarries and is represented by thousands of specimens.  The preservation
  can be so good that the original skin outline and even some of its structure may
  be seen.  This typical thunniform ichthyosaur shows the fusiform shape, larger forelimb
  and crescent tail typical of Jurassic and Cretaceous species.  From Sander (2000).
