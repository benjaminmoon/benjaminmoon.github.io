excerpt: Figure 3. Extinction rates and clade generation rates of ophthalmosaurids
  (an ichthyosaur subgroup) through the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous. The low
  extinction rates show continuation of taxa across the Jurassic/Cretaceous boundary
  (orange). In this data there are no new clades (groups) arising after the Late Jurassic.
