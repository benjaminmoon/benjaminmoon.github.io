excerpt: |-
  Nisus Writer Pro main window with a text document exported from Scrivener, hence the coloured revisions. The document is viewable as pages, as
  here, or continuous roll. The expected assortment of tools are present,
  either as menus, or in a ‘drawer’ at
  the side of the window (not shown).
