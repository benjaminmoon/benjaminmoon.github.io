excerpt: Example of correlation over sections using fossils.  Each stratum with a
  certain fossil was deposited at a certain time.  The different thicknesses can be
  caused by different sedimentation rates or the spread of the species itself.  Where
  there is no occurrence, indicates that so sediment was deposited, the species could
  not colonise that environment or there has been erosion causing an unconformity.
