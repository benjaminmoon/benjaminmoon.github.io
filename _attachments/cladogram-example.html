excerpt: Fig. 1 Example cladogram created from the matrix in table 1 using PHYLIP
  3.69  (Felsenstein 2009).  This analysis shows that E and B are closely related
  and most derived.  Their clade, A and C could not  be resolved fully, resulting
  in a polytomy.  D is the least derived.  D is the outgroup to all others.  Also,
  A, C and D is the outgroup to B and E.
